## 🌐 Your Working Setup

### 1. Local Server (Running)
```bash
python simple-server-fixed.py
```
- **Local URL:** http://localhost:3000
- **Health Check:** http://localhost:3000/health
- **Status:** ✅ Running in Terminal 1

### 2. Public Tunnel (Working)
```bash
lt --port 3000
```
- **Tool:** LocalTunnel (bypasses Sophos antivirus)
- **URL:** Your LocalTunnel URL (e.g., `https://abc-123.loca.lt`)
- **Status:** ✅ Successfully installed and working

## 🤖 OpenAI Assistant Setup

### Step 1: Create Assistant
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/assistants
2. Click "Create Assistant"
3. Fill in:
   - **Name:** AI Tutor
   - **Instructions:** 
   ```
   You are an adaptive AI tutor for international school students. Use the get_student_context function to access student profiles, progress data, and curriculum information. Personalize your teaching based on the student's learning style, interests, and current progress. Always align lessons with Cambridge Primary curriculum requirements.
   ```
   - **Model:** gpt-4o (recommended) or gpt-4

### Step 2: Add Function Tool
Click "Add Tool" → "Function" → "Create":

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** There is NO "Function URL" field in OpenAI Assistant setup!

**Function Definition:**
- **Name:** `get_student_context`
- **Description:** `Get comprehensive student profile, progress, and curriculum data`
- **Parameters:**
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "student_id": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Student identifier (e.g., 'emma_smith')"
    }
  },
  "required": ["student_id"]
}
```

**How it works:**
1. Assistant calls the function (doesn't call HTTP directly)
2. You get a function call response from OpenAI
3. Your code calls your LocalTunnel URL
4. You send the result back to the Assistant

### Step 3: Integration Method

**Option A: Use OpenAI Playground (Easiest for testing)**
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/playground
2. Select your Assistant
3. Ask: "Tell me about Emma Smith's learning progress"
4. You'll see a function call response - manually test your URL

**Option B: Use API Integration (Full setup)**
Create a simple integration script - see next section

### Step 4: Complete Integration Setup

I've created [`ai_tutor_integration.py`](ai_tutor_integration.py) - a complete integration script that handles function calls automatically.

**Required Setup:**

1. **Install OpenAI Python library:**
   ```bash
   pip install openai requests
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```powershell
   # Your OpenAI API key
   set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
   
   # Your Assistant ID (get this after creating the Assistant)
   set ASSISTANT_ID=asst_your-assistant-id
   ```

3. **Update tunnel URL in the script:**
   Edit [`ai_tutor_integration.py`](ai_tutor_integration.py) line 13:
   ```python
   TUNNEL_URL = "https://your-localtunnel-url.loca.lt"  # Your actual URL
   ```

4. **Run the integration:**
   ```bash
   python ai_tutor_integration.py
   ```

**How it works:**
1. You chat with the script
2. Script sends messages to OpenAI Assistant
3. When Assistant calls functions, script calls your local server
4. Results are sent back to Assistant
5. You get the full AI response with student data

## 🧪 Test Your System

### Quick Health Check
Visit your LocalTunnel URL + `/health`:
```
https://your-url.loca.lt/health
```
Should return: `{"status": "healthy", "server": "Python AI Tutor Server"}`

### Function Test
Visit your LocalTunnel URL + `/mcp/get-student-context?student_id=emma_smith`:
```
https://your-url.loca.lt/mcp/get-student-context?student_id=emma_smith
```
Should return comprehensive student data including profile, progress, and curriculum.
