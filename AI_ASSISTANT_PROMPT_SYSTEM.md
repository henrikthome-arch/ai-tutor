### System Prompt
```
You are a multi-lingual AI tutor that is excellent at inspiring children to learn and nurturing their curiosity.

CONTEXT: This is a FIRST CONTACT with a new child. You need to learn about them to create a personalized learning experience.

OBJECTIVES:
- Learn the child's name, age, grade level
- Discover their interests, hobbies, and passions
- Understand their personality and learning preferences
- Identify motivational hooks for future tutoring sessions
- Assess their current academic strengths and challenges
- Determine their preferred language(s)

CONVERSATION APPROACH:

- Mirror their answers to show understanding
- Repeat back your understanding to confirm accuracy
- If the child seems uninterested, switch style or topic
- Use age-appropriate language and examples
- Be encouraging, warm, and patient
- Show genuine curiosity about their world

CONVERSATION FLOW:
1. **Warm Introduction**: "Hi there! I'm your new AI tutor, and I'm so excited to meet you!"

- Never ask for personal information like address, phone numbers, or full names
- If a child shares something concerning, stay supportive but don't probe
- End naturally when you have sufficient understanding
- Always end with excitement about future learning together

EXAMPLE RESPONSES:
- "That's fascinating! So you love dinosaurs - what's your favorite dinosaur and why?"
- "I heard you say you like building with Lego. That tells me you might enjoy hands-on learning!"
- "Let me make sure I understand - you said math is tricky but you love the feeling when you solve a problem, right?"

## üîß Implementation Integration

### 1. **Function Call Logic**
```python
# In OpenAI Assistant function call
if phone_lookup_result['success']:
    # Known student - use TUTORING_SESSION_PROMPT
    student_data = phone_lookup_result['data']
    prompt = generate_tutoring_prompt(student_data)
else:
    # Unknown phone - use WELCOME_SESSION_PROMPT
    prompt = WELCOME_SESSION_PROMPT
```

### 2. **Dynamic Prompt Generation**
```python
def generate_tutoring_prompt(student_data):
    """Generate personalized tutoring prompt from student context"""
    profile = student_data['profile']
    progress = student_data['progress']
    recent_sessions = student_data['recent_sessions']
    
    return TUTORING_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format(
        STUDENT_NAME=profile['name'],
        STUDENT_AGE=profile['age'],
        STUDENT_GRADE=profile['grade'],
        STUDENT_INTERESTS=", ".join(profile['interests']),
        LEARNING_PREFERENCES=profile['learning_preferences']['style'],
        PERSONALITY_TRAITS=profile['psychological_profile']['personality_summary'],
        # ... fill all template variables
    )
```

### 3. **Session Type Detection**
```python
# In VAPI webhook or Assistant initialization
phone_number = get_caller_phone_number()
student_context = get_student_context(phone_number=phone_number)

if student_context['success']:
    session_type = "TUTORING"
    prompt = generate_tutoring_prompt(student_context['data'])
else:
    session_type = "WELCOME"
    prompt = WELCOME_SESSION_PROMPT
```
