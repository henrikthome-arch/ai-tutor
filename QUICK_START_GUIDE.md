# 🚀 Quick Start - Your AI Tutor is Ready!

## ✅ What I Just Did For You

1. **✅ Cloud URL Already Set** - The integration script already points to your live server
2. **✅ Created [`.env`](.env) file** - Template for your API keys  
3. **✅ Updated integration script** - Now uses .env files automatically
4. **✅ Updated requirements** - Added all needed dependencies
5. **✅ Added `.gitignore`** - Protects your API keys from being committed

## 🎯 What You Need To Do (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Get Your API Keys
1. **OpenAI API Key:** https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. **Create OpenAI Assistant:** https://platform.openai.com/assistants

### Step 3: Edit Your .env File
Open [`.env`](.env) and replace the placeholders:

```bash
# Your actual OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-real-api-key-here

# Your actual Assistant ID (from step 2)
ASSISTANT_ID=asst_your-real-assistant-id-here
```

### Step 4: Test Your System
```bash
python ai_tutor_integration.py
```

**Try this message:** `"Tell me about Emma Smith's learning progress"`
