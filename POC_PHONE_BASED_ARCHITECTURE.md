# üéØ AI Tutor PoC - Phone-Based Architecture

## üìã Overview

This architecture uses **phone number identification** with **automatic student onboarding**. Unknown numbers trigger welcome calls that gather student information, while known numbers proceed directly to tutoring.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Smart Phone-Based Identification

### **Core Design Principle**
```yaml
Concept: "Your phone number is your student ID"

Workflow:
  Known_Number: Phone ‚Üí Student lookup ‚Üí Personalized tutoring
  Unknown_Number: Phone ‚Üí Welcome call ‚Üí Profile creation ‚Üí Future tutoring

Benefits:
  ‚úÖ Natural authentication (everyone has a phone number)
  ‚úÖ Automatic onboarding for new students
  ‚úÖ Single VAPI assistant handles everything
  ‚úÖ No complex setup required
  ‚úÖ Seamless user experience
```

---

## üîß Architecture Components

### **1. Single VAPI Assistant (Handles All Students)**

#### **VAPI Configuration**
```yaml
VAPI_Assistant_Name: "International School AI Tutor"
Phone_Number: "+1-555-SCHOOL-AI"  # Single number for all students
OpenAI_Assistant_ID: "asst_tutor_123"

# Key: VAPI provides caller number as environment variable
Environment_Variables:
  CALLER_PHONE_NUMBER: "{{caller.phoneNumber}}"  # VAPI built-in variable
  
Webhook_URL: "https://ai-tutor-ptnl.onrender.com/webhook/vapi/session-complete"
```

### **2. Smart OpenAI Assistant Instructions**

#### **Assistant Configuration**
```yaml
Assistant_Name: "International School AI Tutor"
Instructions: |
  You are an AI tutor for an international school (Grades 1-6, Cambridge Primary curriculum).
  
  IMPORTANT: Start every conversation by calling get-student-context with the caller's phone number.
  
  The response will tell you:
  1. If this is a KNOWN STUDENT: You'll get their profile, progress, and learning preferences
  2. If this is a NEW STUDENT: You'll get a "new_student" indicator
  
  For KNOWN STUDENTS:
  - Greet them by name and reference their recent progress
  - Ask what they'd like to work on today
  - Adapt to their learning style and grade level
  - Keep sessions engaging and curriculum-aligned
  
  For NEW STUDENTS:
  - Welcome them warmly to the tutoring system
  - Explain that you're their AI tutor and you'd like to learn about them
  - Ask for: Name, Age, Grade, Favorite subjects, Interests, Learning preferences
  - Keep the conversation friendly and engaging
  - End by saying you'll remember everything for next time
  
  Always be encouraging, age-appropriate, and educational.

Tools:
  - get-student-context: Get student data by phone number OR create new student profile

Model: gpt-4-turbo
Temperature: 0.7

### **3. Enhanced MCP Server (Phone-Based Lookup)**

#### **Phone-Based Student Context Function**
```python

## üîÑ Complete User Journey

### **First Call (New Student)**
```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Student calls +1-555-SCHOOL-AI] --> B[VAPI provides phone number to Assistant]
    B --> C[Assistant calls get-student-context with phone]
    C --> D[MCP: Phone not found - return new_student context]
    D --> E[Assistant: Welcome conversation]
    E --> F[Student shares: name, age, grade, interests]
    F --> G[Call ends - VAPI sends transcript]
    G --> H[Post-processor extracts student info]
    H --> I[Creates profile.json and progress.json]
    I --> J[Maps phone number to new student_id]
```

### **Second Call (Existing Student)**
```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Same student calls again] --> B[VAPI provides same phone number]
    B --> C[Assistant calls get-student-context with phone]
    C --> D[MCP: Phone found - return full student context]

## üìä Implementation Examples

### **Phone Mapping File**
```json
{
  "phone_to_student": {
    "+15551234567": "emma_4567",
    "+15559876543": "jane_6543",
    "+15555555555": "alex_5555"
  },
  "last_updated": "2025-01-17T14:30:00Z"
}
```

### **New Student Profile Creation**
```python
# Example welcome conversation extraction
transcript = """
AI: Hello! I'm your AI tutor. What's your name?
Student: I'm Emma!
AI: Nice to meet you Emma! How old are you?
Student: I'm 9 years old.
AI: What grade are you in?
Student: I'm in 4th grade.
AI: What subjects do you like?
Student: I love math and science! And I really like animals.
"""

# Extracted information
extracted_info = {
    "name": "Emma",
    "age": 9,
    "grade": 4,
    "favorite_subjects": ["math", "science"],
    "interests": ["animals"]
}

# Generated student_id: "emma_4567" (name + last 4 of phone)
```

### **Enhanced Assistant Instructions Example**
```yaml
# When Emma calls again:
Assistant_Response_Context:
  student_type: "existing"
  student_id: "emma_4567" 
  name: "Emma"
  grade: 4
  last_session: "worked on fractions"
  interests: ["animals", "space"]
  
Assistant_Greeting: "Hi Emma! Last time we worked on fractions with pizza slices. How did that go? Ready for more math today, or would you like to explore something else?"
```

## üéØ Testing Workflow

### **Test Case 1: New Student**
```bash
# Simulate new phone number calling
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp/get-student-context \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone_number": "+15551234567"}'

# Expected response: new_student context with onboarding questions
```

### **Test Case 2: Existing Student** 
```bash
# Same phone number after profile creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp/get-student-context \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone_number": "+15551234567"}'

# Expected response: full student context with profile/progress
```

### **Test Case 3: Welcome Session Processing**
```bash
# Process welcome conversation transcript
python process_welcome_session.py "+15551234567" "welcome_transcript.txt"

# Expected: New student profile created, phone mapped
```

## üîÆ Future Evolution

### **Current PoC: Phone Number Authentication**
```yaml
Authentication: "Phone number = student identity"
Onboarding: "Automatic via welcome conversation"
Security: "Basic (phone number verification)"
```

### **Future Production Options**
```yaml
Enhanced_Authentication:
  - Voice biometrics overlaid on phone numbers
  - PIN verification for shared phones
  - Parent approval for new registrations
  - Multi-factor for sensitive operations

Advanced_Onboarding:
  - Parent consent workflows
  - School enrollment integration
  - Academic assessment during onboarding
  - Learning style diagnostic tests
```

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

### **PoC Validation**
- ‚úÖ New phone numbers trigger welcome conversations
- ‚úÖ Welcome conversations create complete student profiles
- ‚úÖ Known phone numbers load existing student context
- ‚úÖ Assistant adapts behavior based on student type
- ‚úÖ Post-processing automatically creates students

### **User Experience**
- ‚úÖ Natural, no-setup experience for students
- ‚úÖ Seamless transition from onboarding to tutoring
- ‚úÖ Personalized experience from second call onwards
- ‚úÖ Easy for schools to add new students (just give them the number)

This phone-based approach provides the perfect balance of **simplicity for the PoC** while maintaining **natural user experience** and **easy scalability**. Students just call a number - that's it!
