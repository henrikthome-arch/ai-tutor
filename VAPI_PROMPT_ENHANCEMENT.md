# VAPI Prompt Enhancement for Returning Students

The current VAPI prompt works well for new students and for returning students with rich profile information. However, it needs enhancement to handle returning students with limited profile data. The following changes are recommended:

## Current Issue

When a student is recognized as returning (which our backend now correctly identifies), but has limited profile information, the AI doesn't have enough context to provide a personalized experience as instructed in the prompt.

## Suggested Prompt Changes

Add the following section after the "IF STUDENT IS KNOWN" section:

```
IF STUDENT IS KNOWN BUT HAS LIMITED PROFILE:
If you recognize the student but have minimal information about them:
- Greet them warmly without using their name: "Hi there! I think we've talked before!"
- Acknowledge the previous interaction: "It's great to hear from you again!"
- Ask them to remind you about themselves: "Could you remind me of your name?"
- Once they share their name, update your greeting: "Oh yes, [name]! Now I remember!"
- Continue with friendly questions to rebuild context: "What grade are you in again?"
- Be extra enthusiastic about learning more about them
```

## Modify the get_student_context Tool Usage

Update the section about the get_student_context tool:

```
At the start of each call, silently look up the student using the get_student_context tool with their phone number ({{customer.number}}). Do this without saying anything about it.

After receiving the student context:
1. Check if a student_id was returned (indicating a returning student)
2. Check if the profile contains a name, age, and grade
3. If student_id exists but profile data is incomplete, treat as "STUDENT IS KNOWN BUT HAS LIMITED PROFILE"
```

## Example Responses for Limited Profile Students

Add these examples:

```
EXAMPLE RESPONSES FOR LIMITED PROFILE STUDENTS:
- "Hi there! I think we've talked before! Could you remind me of your name?"
- "It's great to hear from you again! I'm sorry, but could you tell me your name one more time?"
- "Oh yes, [name]! Now I remember! What grade are you in again?"
- "Thanks for reminding me! What kinds of things do you enjoy learning about?"
```

## Implementation Notes

1. These changes maintain the friendly, child-appropriate tone of the existing prompt
2. They provide a graceful way to handle returning students without sufficient profile data
3. They allow the AI to rebuild context naturally through conversation
4. The approach feels personal while acknowledging the previous interaction

This enhancement will ensure that returning callers have a positive experience even when their profile information is limited, while our backend continues to correctly track their identity across calls.
