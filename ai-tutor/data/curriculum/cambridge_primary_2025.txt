Grade	Subject	Mandatory	Details
1	English (Literacy)	Yes	"Reading: Recognize all letters of the English alphabet and their sounds; begin blending sounds to read simple words and short sentences. Students enjoy listening to and reading simple stories, poems, and rhymes. Writing: Hold a pencil correctly and write basic words. Write simple sentences with correct use of capital letters and full stops (periods). Speaking/Listening: Follow basic instructions and engage in imaginative play to practice speaking; learn to take turns in conversation and listen to others in group activities."
1	Mathematics	Yes	"Learn the foundation of the number system up to 20: count, read, and write numbers from 0 to 20. Count forwards and backwards, and begin skip counting by 2s and 10s. Understand basic addition and subtraction with single-digit numbers (e.g. using objects or fingers). Identify simple 2D shapes (circle, square, triangle, rectangle) and some 3D shapes. Begin to grasp measurement concepts by comparing lengths or weights and recognize clocks (learn to tell time to the hour). Solve very simple word problems with guidance, and start making estimations for quantities."
1	Science	Yes	"Begin exploring the environment and world through observation and curiosity. Distinguish living vs. non-living things and recognize that plants and animals are living beings that inhabit the environment. Identify basic parts of plants (leaf, root, stem) and animals (head, legs, etc.), and understand that humans are animals too. Explore the five senses by observing different materials (e.g. rough vs smooth, what they smell or sound like). Observe movement and forces: learn that pushing or pulling can move objects and change their speed or direction. Recognize different sound sources (e.g. identify loud vs soft sounds). Overall, Stage 1 science encourages curiosity about the immediate world around them."
1	Global Perspectives (Cambridge)	No	"Students are introduced to global awareness through simple, age-appropriate topics. They begin developing foundational skills in research and communication as part of Cambridge Primary Global Perspectives. For example, in Stage 1 they might explore the theme “Growing and growing up,” sharing how they have changed since babyhood. They learn to observe and ask basic questions about their immediate world (family, friends, local community) and compare with others’ experiences. Through guided activities, they practice expressing their ideas with the class and listening to different perspectives, laying the groundwork for collaboration and reflection on a very simple level."
1	Computing / ICT	No	"Learn basic digital skills. Students become familiar with using a computer or tablet under supervision – for example, learning how to use a mouse or touchscreen and open a simple program. They practice recognizing letters and numbers on a keyboard. They begin to understand that technology (like computers and tablets) can be used to play educational games, to draw pictures, or to listen to stories. Emphasis is on developing comfort with technology and learning simple digital vocabulary (screen, mouse, keyboard, etc.). They may also engage in basic coding concepts through playful activities (such as arranging arrows to move a character in a game), learning the idea of giving instructions to achieve a result."
1	Art & Design	No	"Explore colors, shapes, and basic art materials. Students learn the names of primary colors and experiment with mixing colors (e.g. discovering that blue and yellow make green). They practice holding and using crayons, brushes, and safety scissors. They create simple drawings and paintings of familiar subjects (like their family, house, trees, sun) focusing on basic shapes. They also work with clay or playdough to make very simple sculptures (e.g. rolling a ball or making a snake shape). Art in Grade 1 emphasizes creativity and motor skills: by year-end, students should be able to draw and color a simple scene, recognizing basic colors and shapes, and show confidence in trying different art activities. They also learn to talk briefly about their artwork (e.g. “This is my dog, it’s brown.”)."
1	Music	No	"Develop enjoyment of music and basic musical skills. Students learn to recognize and repeat simple rhythms (clapping or tapping a steady beat). They sing simple songs and nursery rhymes in a group, developing their ability to match pitch and remember lyrics. They are introduced to common classroom instruments (like shaker, tambourine, triangle) and explore the sounds they make. By the end of Grade 1, students can distinguish between loud vs. soft sounds and high vs. low pitches. They can perform a very simple song or rhyme from memory with the class, keep a basic beat, and have experienced making sounds with different instruments. The emphasis is on fostering a love of music and comfort with singing and moving to music."
1	Physical Education (PE)	No	"Focus on fundamental motor skills and active play. Students practice gross motor skills like running, jumping, hopping, and throwing in fun games. They learn to follow simple game rules (e.g. taking turns, stopping when a signal is given). By the end of Grade 1, they should be able to run and change direction without falling, throw or roll a ball towards a target, and catch a large ball with both hands. They also work on balance (e.g. walking on a line or low balance beam) and coordination (skipping, galloping). PE at this stage also emphasizes teamwork and social skills: students practice cooperating with partners or small groups in simple activities. The goal is for children to enjoy exercise, develop basic physical confidence, and understand simple concepts like warm-up or why we move our bodies."
2	English (Literacy)	Yes	"Reading: By the end of Grade 2 (Cambridge Stage 2), students can read short stories and informational texts for their age. They have a solid grasp of phonics, enabling them to decode unfamiliar words. They read a wider variety of texts including fairy tales, simple real-life stories, and poems. They can answer basic who/what/when/where/why questions about a text to show comprehension. Writing: Students write their own short stories and sentences that form a logical sequence (beginning, middle, end). They are starting to use connecting words like “and”, “but” to form compound sentences. They also practice writing simple instructions or a short description of a familiar topic. By this stage, they use correct past and present tenses for common verbs and punctuate sentences with capital letters and full stops correctly. Speaking/Listening: Grade 2 students can participate in short discussions, answering questions about stories and retelling events in order. They practice speaking in complete sentences and begin to use expressive vocabulary to describe events or their feelings. They listen to others and respond to “why” questions with brief explanations. Overall, by the end of Grade 2, students are becoming more independent readers and writers of short texts and are expanding their vocabulary and confidence in English."
2	Mathematics	Yes	"Numbers: Extend understanding of numbers up to 100. Students can read, write, and sequence numbers 0–100 and count forwards/backwards within this range. They practice skip counting by 2s, 5s, and 10s, and are introduced to counting in 3s and 4s as well. They solidify addition and subtraction facts up to 20 and learn to add/subtract two-digit numbers (without complex regrouping). Fractions: Recognize simple fractions: 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 (e.g. understanding 1/2 as one of two equal parts). Measurement: Tell time to the half-hour and perhaps quarter-hour on analog clocks; compare lengths, weights, and capacities using non-standard and simple standard units (cm, m; g, kg; ml, L in an intuitive way). Geometry: Identify common 2D shapes (circle, square, triangle, rectangle, oval) and 3D shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder) in their environment. They learn basic properties like number of sides or corners. Word Problems: Solve simple word problems involving addition or subtraction, showing understanding of what operation to use (with teacher guidance). They also start making estimations (e.g. guessing how many candies in a jar and then counting) to build reasoning. By end of Grade 2, students are expected to be comfortable with basic arithmetic within 100, understand halves and quarters, and apply math to simple everyday scenarios (time, sharing, measuring objects)."
2	Science	Yes	"Grade 2 students expand their scientific thinking and begin to do simple investigations. Scientific inquiry: They make predictions (e.g. “I think this plant will grow taller in the sun than in shade”) and collect simple data under teacher guidance – like measuring how much a plant grew or which objects sink or float. They start using simple tools (a ruler for length, a thermometer for temperature, etc.) to make observations. Biology: Students learn about weather and seasonal changes, and discuss how to care for the environment (e.g. not littering, watering plants). They study how plants and animals grow and what they need (water, food, light) – building a small foundation in life cycles (perhaps observing a seed sprout). Chemistry: They explore materials more deeply – distinguishing natural vs. man-made materials. For instance, they learn wood and cotton come from plants (natural), while plastic and glass are manufactured. They also observe simple material changes (ice melting into water, water freezing) to learn about hot and cold. Physics: Key topics include light and dark (recognizing that darkness is the absence of light, the sun is a light source, whereas the moon reflects light) and an introduction to electricity (maybe a basic circuit with a battery, bulb, and wire in very simple form). By the end of Grade 2, students should be able to ask questions like “What will happen if…?”, make simple observations to answer those questions, and have a broader understanding of nature (weather, caring for Earth) and basic physical phenomena (light, simple circuits)."
2	Global Perspectives (Cambridge)	No	"Building on Stage 1, Grade 2 students take on slightly more complex global topics and skills. They might undertake up to six Global Perspectives Challenges in the year. For example, they could explore a topic like “Family, Friends, Community” by comparing how birthdays are celebrated in their family versus in another country. Collaboration: Students work in pairs or small groups to collect very simple information – e.g. each child asks a family member what their favorite food is, and the class compares results (learning that people have different preferences). Research and Analysis: They learn to gather evidence in a basic way (like observing weather for a week to see patterns) and answer a question with that evidence. Reflection: They begin to reflect on what they found (“Most of us have a birthday cake; in some cultures they have a special dessert instead”). By end of Grade 2, they can contribute to a simple group presentation (with teacher support) on a local/global topic (like making a poster on “How we care for our school and Earth”). They are developing curiosity beyond their immediate experience and the ability to see that other people may have different lives or viewpoints."
2	Computing / ICT	No	"Continue developing digital literacy. In Grade 2, students use computers/tablets with growing confidence. They practice basic typing: writing simple words and sentences using a keyboard (e.g. typing their name, a short sentence like “I like cats.”). They learn to use fundamental keys (space bar, backspace, enter). They also begin using educational software or apps for math, reading, or art – learning to navigate menus with guidance. Coding/Computational thinking: Students might use block-based coding tools designed for young children (like dragging blocks to move a character through a maze) to develop logical thinking. They learn concepts like “sequence” (steps in order) and “debugging” (fixing a mistake if the sequence doesn’t do what was expected) in a very simple, visual way. Internet safety: Students are introduced to the idea that computers can connect to the internet, and basic safety like not clicking on unknown pop-ups and always asking an adult before using the internet. By the end of Grade 2, they can open a simple program or app on their own, save their work (with help), and understand that computers follow instructions we give. They also create a very basic piece of digital content, like a drawing in a paint program or a short typed message."
2	Art & Design	No	"Develop art skills and creativity further. Students in Grade 2 learn about color mixing more formally – they explore creating secondary colors (green, orange, purple) from primary colors and experiment with lighter/darker shades (adding white or black paint). They practice drawing more detailed pictures, adding backgrounds and multiple elements (e.g. not just a tree, but a tree with grass, sun, clouds, maybe a person or house). They are introduced to simple concepts of form and texture – for instance, making a collage from different materials (paper, fabric, leaves) to feel textures, or building slightly more detailed clay figures (adding facial features or patterns). They might study very basic art from different cultures or famous artists at an age-appropriate level – e.g. looking at Starry Night by Van Gogh and making a swirly sky painting. By the end of Grade 2, students should be able to plan a simple artwork (deciding what to draw or make), mix and use a variety of colors, and have improved fine motor control (coloring within lines more carefully, cutting shapes with scissors). They are also encouraged to talk about their art and others’: they can say what they like in an artwork and begin to use art vocabulary (like colors, shapes, pattern)."
2	Music	No	"Grade 2 music builds on rhythm and pitch skills. Rhythm: Students can clap or play rhythms that include quarter notes (ta) and eighth-note pairs (ti-ti) in patterns. They learn to differentiate rhythm patterns and might learn simple notation symbols for these rhythms (in a very basic way). Pitch and Melody: They expand their repertoire of songs, including folk songs or cultural songs appropriate for children. They practice matching pitch more accurately and may begin singing rounds or echoes (one group starts a simple melody, another joins in later) to develop listening skills. Some basic introduction to musical concepts occurs: high vs low pitch, fast vs slow tempo, loud vs soft dynamics – and students demonstrate these (e.g. singing a song loudly, then softly). They explore more classroom instruments: xylophones or glockenspiels may be introduced so they can play simple melodies or at least strike specific bars to accompany a song. By year’s end, students can perform a memorized song with confidence, keep a steady beat on percussion while singing, and identify a few instruments by sound (piano, drum, trumpet perhaps through listening exercises). They also experience creating their own small music patterns – like improvising a two-note melody or a simple rhythm to express an idea."
2	Physical Education (PE)	No	"Continue developing physical abilities. In Grade 2, students refine locomotor skills: running with changes of speed, jumping with control (jumping and landing on two feet, hopping on one foot farther, etc.), and dodging obstacles. They also practice kicking and striking skills – for example, kicking a stationary ball toward a goal, hitting a ball off a tee with a bat or paddle – to improve coordination. Games: They can participate in very simple team games that involve cooperation, like relay races or “passing the ball” games, learning sportsmanship and following slightly more complex rules than in Grade 1. They are introduced to basic concepts of fitness: understanding that exercise makes their heart beat faster and that stretching can be good for muscles. Dance/Movement: They might learn simple folk dances or movement sequences to music, which helps with rhythm and balance. By end of Grade 2, children should be able to throw and catch a medium-sized ball consistently, balance on one foot for a longer time, and perform a series of movements (like jump, turn, clap, skip) in order. They also show cooperative behavior—taking turns, encouraging teammates—and understand the concept of fair play. Safety is emphasized (e.g. looking where they run, using equipment properly). Overall, they gain greater control over their movements and can engage in structured play with peers."
3	English (Literacy)	Yes	"In Grade 3 (Cambridge Stage 3), students transition from learning-to-read to reading-to-learn. Reading: They are introduced to a wider range of literature including fantasy stories, myths and legends, and plays. They not only read the texts but also begin to discuss them: by the end of Grade 3, students can identify key characters and describe basic story plots, and they start to infer meanings (e.g. how a character feels, even if not stated explicitly). They practice reading silently for longer passages, as well as reading aloud with appropriate phrasing. Writing: There’s a strong focus on improving handwriting in Grade 3; students work on writing more neatly and fluently in cursive or joined-up letters. They learn to write structured paragraphs, for instance a story with a clear beginning, middle, end, adding details about characters and settings. Their grammar usage grows: they start using more complex sentences, including noun phrases (e.g. “the large, brown dog” instead of just “the dog”) and correct usage of past, present, and future tenses. They are expected to use punctuation such as commas in lists and apostrophes for common contractions (can’t, don’t). Speaking/Listening: Grade 3 students take part in group discussions, learning to consider others’ viewpoints and take turns speaking. They might give a short presentation or recitation (like reading a poem aloud to the class or doing a short role-play from a play script). They listen to their peers and can summarize in their own words what someone else said. By the end of Grade 3, students are increasingly confident readers and writers: they can independently read and understand a chapter-book appropriate to their age, and write a coherent story or report of a few paragraphs. Their spoken language is more organized and they can express ideas or retell events with some detail."
3	Mathematics	Yes	"In Grade 3, students solidify fundamental arithmetic and expand into new areas. Number and Operations: They confidently work with numbers up to 1,000. By the end of Grade 3, students can recite numbers up to 200 and beyond, and place them in order. They add and subtract 3-digit numbers (often using techniques like carrying/borrowing) reliably. Multiplication & Division: Grade 3 has a strong focus on multiplication tables. Students are expected to master the 2×, 3×, 5×, and 10× times tables, and typically also learn 4× (and possibly 6×) by year’s end. They use these facts to solve multiplication problems (e.g. 4 × 7) and are introduced to basic division as the inverse of multiplication (e.g. knowing 5 × 6 = 30 so 30 ÷ 5 = 6). Fractions: They learn to compare and order simple fractions and find basic equivalents (e.g. recognizing that 2/4 is the same as 1/2). They might place fractions on a number line or find which of two fractions is larger using visual models. Data Handling: Students begin developing data skills – they collect simple data (like students’ favorite fruits) and learn to organize it into charts. They interpret tally charts, pictograms, and bar charts, answering questions like “Which category has the most/least?”. They may also encounter Venn diagrams with two overlapping categories to sort objects or numbers, and interpret simple findings from them. Geometry & Measurement: Students identify properties of shapes: e.g. recognize different types of triangles (perhaps by angles or sides), rectangles vs. other quadrilaterals, etc. They learn the concept of perimeter (calculating the distance around a shape) and might be introduced to area by counting square units. They tell time to the nearest 5 minutes and solve time problems involving hours and minutes differences. They also begin using standard units more consistently – cm, m for length; g, kg for weight; L, mL for volume – and convert simple amounts (like 100 cm = 1 m). By the end of Grade 3, students have a “strong understanding” of the number system and basic operations, know key multiplication facts by heart, and can apply math in practical ways such as reading graphs or measuring objects. This foundation prepares them for the larger numbers and more complex operations of Grade 4."
3	Science	Yes	"Grade 3 science (Cambridge Stage 3) introduces new concepts and builds on earlier ones. Biology: Students delve into life processes of living things, learning basic functions such as nutrition, movement, and reproduction in animals. For instance, they might learn the needs of plants (light, water, soil) and how plants reproduce through seeds, or learn how animals have babies (mammals vs. egg-laying animals) – simple life cycles like frog (egg to tadpole to frog) or butterfly (caterpillar to butterfly) could be covered. They also study how living things are adapted to their environment (e.g. fish have gills to breathe in water). Physics: A major new topic is forces and motion. Students investigate how forces like push, pull, and friction affect movement. They might do experiments like dragging objects on different surfaces to see where they move easier or slower, learning that friction can slow things down. They learn that forces can change an object’s speed or shape (like squeezing a sponge changes its shape). Magnetism is introduced: students discover that magnets attract certain metals and have poles, and they explore simple uses of magnets (like a compass or fridge magnet). Chemistry: They focus on material properties. Students compare materials by qualities (hard/soft, shiny/dull, flexible/rigid, waterproof/absorbent, etc.). They test materials to see which are good for certain purposes (e.g. which fabric is best to repel water). Additionally, Grade 3 often introduces that some changes to materials are reversible and some are not, in a basic way (e.g. dissolving sugar in water vs. frying an egg). Scientific Skills: Throughout these topics, students carry on developing inquiry skills – making predictions, doing simple tests, and recording results in structured ways (maybe filling in a basic results table or bar chart with teacher’s help). They start to grasp the concept of a “fair test” (changing one factor at a time). By the end of Grade 3, students have a more systematic understanding of science: they can explain simple cause and effect (like “Friction makes it harder for the toy car to move”), identify characteristics of living things, and group materials or living organisms based on properties (e.g. magnetic vs non-magnetic, plants vs animals). This stage bridges the concrete observations of earlier years with more explanatory frameworks (introducing terms like friction, magnet, nutrition, etc.)."
3	Global Perspectives (Cambridge)	No	"In Stage 3 of Global Perspectives, students begin to broaden their view from local to more regional or global issues in a simple way, and enhance their collaboration and evaluation skills. They might undertake projects such as “Looking after Planet Earth” at an introductory level – for example, investigating how children can help keep their school or neighborhood clean, and comparing it with what kids do in another country (pen-pal or video exchange with a class abroad discussing recycling). Research: By Grade 3, students can collect information from easy sources – like reading a simple chart or interviewing classmates – and sort that information. For instance, they might do a small survey (with teacher help) about classmates’ recycling habits and create a pictogram of results. Analysis: They learn to identify patterns or differences in their data (e.g. “More students walk to school than take the bus” in our class vs another school’s class). Reflection: Students are encouraged to reflect on why differences exist (perhaps cultural or contextual reasons) – though at this age, explanations are basic. Communication: They practice presenting what they found in a group poster or short talk, learning to speak clearly and use perhaps one visual aid (like showing a drawing or chart). Collaboration: They take on roles in a team (one student draws, another writes, another speaks) to accomplish the challenge. By the end of Grade 3, learners can engage in a group inquiry on a global topic relevant to them, use simple data to support their ideas, and appreciate that the same issue (like caring for the environment, or healthy eating) might be viewed or handled differently in another community. They are essentially embedding the six skill strands (research, analysis, evaluation, reflection, collaboration, communication) at a beginner level across broader topics."
3	Computing / ICT	No	"In Grade 3, students begin to use technology more independently and learn foundational concepts of computer science. General ICT: They regularly use computers for schoolwork – for example, typing a short story or report in a word processor (learning to use basic formatting like bold or underline), or doing a simple slide show with a few slides (perhaps inserting an image). They learn file management basics: opening/saving files, understanding that their work is stored as a file. Internet Skills: Under supervision, they might perform a simple child-friendly web search (e.g. using a curated safe search engine or web directory to find information about a topic like “rainforests”) and learn how to identify useful information. This comes with reinforcement of internet safety: knowing to never give personal information online, only visiting teacher-approved sites, and telling an adult if they encounter anything uncomfortable. Coding/Computational Thinking: Grade 3 often introduces a more formal coding environment – such as Scratch Jr. or the full Scratch interface – where students create simple programs. They learn the concept of a loop (repeating actions) and perhaps a basic conditional (if-then) in very simple terms (e.g. “if the character hits the wall, then it will turn”). A typical task could be programming a sprite (character) to move in a square or respond to arrow keys. They also start debugging by finding and fixing errors in a short sequence of instructions. Logical reasoning: They predict what a given simple program will do (“I think this set of instructions will make the cat draw a triangle”). By the end of Grade 3, students should be able to produce a basic animation or interactive story using code blocks, use the computer to create and present information (like a short text with an image), and understand how to be safe and responsible digital citizens."
3	Art & Design	No	"Grade 3 art encourages more creativity and introduces formal artistic concepts. Techniques: Students learn techniques such as shading to create light and dark areas in a drawing (e.g. they might shade a circle to look like a sphere), and texture in painting (using brush strokes or sponges to create different effects). They experiment with color values by adding white (tints) or black (shades) to colors. Drawing: They practice drawing people with more accurate proportions (for instance, a human figure with discernible head, body, limbs in more correct relation). Perspective: A simple notion of perspective may be introduced – like objects drawn smaller appear farther away. Media: They use a variety of media: beyond pencil and paint, they might do printmaking (potato prints or simple linocuts under supervision), weaving crafts, or more advanced sculpture (a clay pot or a mask). Art appreciation: Students might learn about an art piece or style from Greek culture (e.g. geometric patterns in ancient Greek art) or another culture, and then create artwork inspired by that style. They could also be introduced to one or two famous artists (like Pablo Picasso or Frida Kahlo) and attempt artworks in those styles, learning terms like abstract or portrait. Creative process: By the end of Grade 3, students are better at planning and executing art projects – e.g. sketching an idea first, then making the final artwork. They can talk about their work and others’: they might give a simple critique (“I like how you used bright colors” or “Next time I want to make the background more detailed”). They are building confidence in self-expression, with improved fine motor skills and awareness of art elements like color, form, texture, and space."
3	Music	No	"In Grade 3, music education often introduces formal musical notation and more complex performance skills. Pitch and Notation: Students may learn the basics of reading music on the treble clef staff. For instance, they might learn the notes of the C major scale on a staff (do-re-mi… up to do) and understand the correspondence to simple instrument notes (like playing recorder or xylophone). Many schools introduce the recorder around this age: students learn how to produce clear notes on a recorder and play simple melodies (e.g. “Hot Cross Buns”) using notes like B-A-G. They learn to read those notes on sheet music. Rhythm: Students work with rhythmic notation including quarter notes, eighth notes, half notes, and rests. They can clap and count out rhythm patterns (1-2-3-4, etc.) and may play them on percussion instruments within an ensemble. They learn to maintain a steady beat even when others have different rhythms (beginning of polyphonic ensemble skills). Ensemble and Harmony: They might sing rounds or canons in three or four parts, which develops the ear for harmony. They could also be assigned simple ostinato patterns (repeating background patterns) on xylophones or percussion while others sing, learning to hold their part. Musical Concepts: Introduce dynamic markings (forte = loud, piano = soft) and tempo markings (allegro, andante as concepts of fast/slow) and have students demonstrate understanding by playing or clapping accordingly. Music Appreciation: Students listen to longer or more complex pieces of music (maybe a short classical piece like a movement from “The Four Seasons”) and discuss imagery or feelings the music evokes. They learn to identify some instruments by sight and sound (violin, trumpet, drums, etc.), possibly through an “instrument families” lesson. By the end of Grade 3, many students can play a basic instrument melody, read simple music notation (at least rhythms and a few pitches), and sing in tune both unison and simple harmony. They also have a broader exposure to musical styles and are developing an attentive listening habit."
3	Physical Education (PE)	No	"Grade 3 PE often begins to resemble organized sports basics while still focusing on skill development. Sport Skills: Students practice skills for sports like soccer (football) – dribbling a ball with feet, passing to a partner; basketball – bouncing (dribbling) a ball and making simple chest passes; and other sports like tennis or badminton – hitting a balloon or lightweight ball with a racket to a partner to develop hand-eye coordination. They aren’t playing full games yet, but they are learning the fundamental movements used in sports. Gymnastics/Dance: Many curricula introduce basic gymnastics in Grade 3: students learn to perform a sequence that could include a roll (tumble), a balance, and a jump. For instance, they might learn a forward roll, a cartwheel (with help), or a bridge. They practice these on mats with attention to form and safety. In dance, they could learn a choreographed routine incorporating various movements (could be folk dance steps or a simple modern dance). Physical Fitness: Students might start structured exercises (like short runs, relay races, circuits of activities) and learn concepts like endurance, strength, flexibility in very kid-friendly terms. They might even do simple fitness tests (how many jumping jacks in a minute, etc.) to set personal goals. Teamwork and Rules: By the end of Grade 3, children are expected to follow game rules more independently and understand concepts of teamwork and strategy at a basic level (for example, spacing in a game – not crowding the ball, communicating with teammates by calling for the ball). They also learn sportsmanship: congratulating others, handling winning or losing gracefully. Health Education: Some programs include basic health knowledge – the importance of warm-up and cool-down, drinking water, basic anatomy like knowing the heart pumps blood faster during exercise. Overall, a Grade 3 student should show improved coordination (e.g. can catch a small ball with one hand, or kick a moving ball), agility, and the ability to link skills into sequences. They are more confident in a variety of physical activities and understand how practice leads to improvement."
4	English (Literacy)	Yes	"Reading: By Grade 4 (Cambridge Stage 4), students read confidently and begin developing personal reading preferences. They explore longer texts and various genres, both silently and aloud. They read chapter books independently, tackle factual texts (like simple science or history book chapters) and can summarize or identify the main idea and supporting details. They also practice reading with expression, especially through performing play scripts in class, which improves their speaking and interpretive skills. Writing: Writing becomes more refined and creative. Students are encouraged to use interesting and descriptive language – they learn about using strong verbs and vivid adjectives to add detail to their writing. They write multiple-paragraph compositions: stories with richer plots, descriptive essays about a person or place, and basic informational reports (like a short research paragraph about an animal or country). They learn punctuation like quotation marks for dialogue, and how to organize writing into paragraphs with a clear structure (topic sentence, supporting sentences). Grammar lessons cover more complex structures – for example, proper use of commas in complex sentences, distinction between plural and possessive forms (dogs vs. dog’s), and possibly an introduction to present perfect vs. simple past differences in context. Speaking/Listening: Grade 4 students often engage in more formal speaking tasks. They might prepare a short presentation on a topic (e.g. “My Hobby” or a book report) and deliver it to the class, practicing clear speech and eye contact. When reading plays or doing group discussions, they work on speaking loudly and clearly enough for others to hear. They also practice active listening skills: after listening to a peer’s presentation, they should be able to ask a relevant question or recall key points. Literacy Analysis: By the end of Grade 4, in addition to basic comprehension, students start to discuss why characters might have acted a certain way or how an author creates an effect (e.g. “This story made me feel excited because of the words the author used”). They might not use formal literary terms yet, but they recognize elements like setting, conflict, resolution. In summary, by the end of Grade 4, students are competent readers and writers with a growing vocabulary and the ability to use language effectively to inform or entertain. Their written work shows voice and better organization, and their oral communication is more poised and structured."
4	Mathematics	Yes	"Grade 4 mathematics (Cambridge Stage 4) ramps up to larger numbers and more advanced operations while laying groundwork for fractions/decimals. Number sense: Students work with numbers up to 10,000 and beyond. By end of Grade 4, they should comfortably read and write numbers into the ten-thousands and know the place value for each digit. They can quickly identify multiples of common numbers (like is 3,450 a multiple of 5? Yes, because it ends in 0) and recognize patterns (e.g. a number is divisible by 10 if it ends in 0, by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5). Multiplication & Division: They learn to multiply two-digit by one-digit numbers and three-digit by one-digit (like 345 × 7) and to divide three-digit numbers by one-digit (including some with remainders). Times tables mastery extends to all tables up to 10×10 (if not already achieved) and often up to 12×12 by end of year. Fractions and Decimals: They find fractions of quantities (e.g. 1/3 of 21) and learn more fractions equivalences (like 1/2 = 2/4 = 5/10). They also encounter mixed numbers and improper fractions in simple contexts. Decimals are introduced, especially in the context of tenths and hundredths (often via money or measurements, e.g. 0.5 as 1/2 or 0.75 as 3/4). By year’s end, they understand the connection between simple fractions and decimals (like 0.25 = 1/4). Geometry: Students learn about angles and basic geometric constructions. They identify lines of symmetry in shapes and draw symmetrical figures. They learn what geometric nets are (flattened 2D patterns that fold into 3D shapes) and practice visualizing how a net becomes a 3D object. They also classify triangles (equilateral, isosceles, right) and quadrilaterals (square, rectangle, parallelogram, etc.) by properties, and might learn to measure and draw angles with a protractor (starting with easy angles like 90°, 45°). Measurement: Converting between units becomes a focus: e.g. converting cm to m, m to km, g to kg (within the same system), and understanding the relationship (100 cm = 1 m, etc.). They solve problems involving perimeter (all grades by now) and are introduced to area – counting squares and eventually using length × width for rectangles. Time problems might include using the 24-hour clock and calculating intervals across noon or midnight. Data: They interpret and perhaps draw more complex bar graphs and begin to use line graphs for simple data sets (like temperature change over a week). They also calculate averages at a basic level (the term “mean” might come in Grade 5, but in Grade 4 they might intuitively find the average by equalizing or using simple numbers). By the end of Grade 4, students have progressed in arithmetic fluency (including long multiplication and basic long division), understand foundational fraction/decimal ideas, and can apply these to real-world contexts. They have the tools to tackle multi-step problems and explain their reasoning. In short, Grade 4 math sets the stage for the more abstract and higher-value concepts (like advanced fractions, volume, percentages) coming in Grade 5."
4	Science	Yes	"In Grade 4 science (Cambridge Stage 4), students delve deeper into each scientific discipline and refine their investigative skills. Scientific Inquiry: At this level, students are expected to pose questions and formulate simple hypotheses. They learn to design a fair test (e.g. when testing how light affects plant growth, keep all factors same except amount of light) and systematically record results – often presenting findings in charts or graphs. Importantly, they learn to identify patterns in the data and draw conclusions like “The plant with more light grew taller”. Chemistry – States of Matter: A key new topic is understanding solids, liquids, and gases and how they can change state. Students learn the properties of each state and observe examples: water freezing/melting, water boiling into steam, etc. They also explore how some changes are reversible (melting/freezing water) and some are irreversible (burning paper, mixing ingredients and baking a cake). Physics – Electricity & Magnetism: Building on earlier introduction, Grade 4 covers simple electric circuits thoroughly. Students use wires, batteries, bulbs, and switches to make a circuit and learn terms like current, circuit, conductor, insulator. They experiment with series circuits (connecting two bulbs, understanding both need a closed circuit to light) and with switches (open = off). They identify materials that conduct electricity vs. those that don’t. Magnetism is revisited with a bit more depth (the idea of magnetic field might be qualitatively mentioned), and sound is also revisited – perhaps discussing how sound travels (vibrations) and experimenting with making sound louder or softer, higher or lower. Physics – Light: They learn about how light travels in straight lines, how shadows form and change size, and basics of reflection (maybe using mirrors to bounce light) – though light might be emphasized more in some curricula in Grade 4 or Grade 5. Biology – Human Body: Grade 4 biology often introduces human anatomy basics. Students learn about the skeletal system, muscles, and perhaps organs. They might learn the names and functions of major bones (skull protects brain, ribcage protects heart and lungs, etc.) and muscles (heart is a muscle, muscles move bones). This ties into nutrition and health: understanding we need calcium for bones, exercise for muscles. They could also cover classification of living things at a simple level (grouping animals into mammals, birds, reptiles, etc., and plants into categories), to deepen understanding from earlier grades. Environment/Ecology: They might study ecosystems like pond life or forest, understanding food chains (producer, consumer, predator, prey relationships) – though food chains might also be Grade 5 content. By the end of Grade 4, students have a more analytical approach to science. They can conduct an experiment with multiple trials, present their findings in a simple chart or report, and base their conclusions on evidence. They have gained core knowledge: how the human body is structured, how electrical circuits work, and what matter is made of. This prepares them for upper primary where they’ll study life cycles, chemistry of mixtures, more complex forces, and so on."
4	Global Perspectives (Cambridge)	No	"Stage 4 Global Perspectives tasks have students engaging more independently in project work and considering data presentation and patterns in their research. They undertake challenges that might involve local and global comparisons, often requiring them to gather and present information in a structured format. For example, a challenge could be “Healthy Eating Habits”: students might survey their classmates about their daily fruit/vegetable intake, present the data in a chart, and compare it with recommended guidelines or with data from another country (perhaps provided by the teacher). Skills – Collaboration: They now take on more defined roles in a team (e.g. leader, note-taker, presenter) and work on longer projects over multiple lessons, testing their ability to cooperate over time. Research: They use slightly more advanced sources – maybe reading a child-friendly article or looking at a simple website (under guidance) to gather facts. They might conduct an interview with someone (like a family member who lived abroad or a school staff) to gain perspective. Analysis and Evaluation: Students in Grade 4 learn to interpret their findings – for instance, identifying patterns or trends in their data and starting to question why (“Our class wastes X liters of water a day – why do we waste so much? What could we do differently?”). They also evaluate sources at a basic level – recognizing that some information might be from an expert, some from opinion, etc. Reflection: They reflect on their own contribution and what they learned from others. For example, after a project, they might write or discuss “What did I do well in my group? What could I do better next time?” Communication: Presentation skills are honed – perhaps they create a simple poster or a slide presentation and each member speaks about one part. They are encouraged to speak clearly and respond to audience questions. By the end of Grade 4, students are more adept at investigating issues that have both personal and global dimensions (like how climate change might affect their town and also other countries, or how access to education differs globally). They have practiced the full cycle of a small research project: planning, researching, analyzing, presenting, and reflecting. These experiences strengthen their critical thinking and prepare them for even more student-led inquiry in Stage 5."
4	Computing / ICT	No	"In Grade 4, students deepen their understanding of both practical ICT skills and foundational computer science concepts. ICT Skills: They become proficient in common applications. For instance, they might learn to create and format a document with headings, bullets, and images (word processing), make a short presentation with 4–5 slides including text, pictures, maybe a slide transition (presentation software), or use a spreadsheet at a basic level (entering numbers and using it like a table, possibly introducing the concept of a cell and maybe simple sums). They practice using search engines effectively: choosing relevant keywords, skimming search results, and evaluating if a source looks reliable or intended for kids. They also talk about digital citizenship – Grade 4 might address topics like cyberbullying (what to do if someone says mean things online), keeping personal information private online, and understanding that not everything on the internet is true (introduction to fact-checking). Programming: Coding tasks become more ambitious. Using an environment like Scratch, students can create games or interactive stories with multiple sprites and backdrops. They learn programming concepts such as loops (repeat actions), conditions (“if... then” decisions), and possibly variables (a simple use, like keeping score in a game). For example, a Grade 4 student might program a Scratch game where a character collects apples and the score increases – this involves variables for score and conditional logic for when the character touches an apple. They also learn to break down problems (decompose tasks) and write algorithms in pseudo-code or flowcharts before coding. Robotics/Physical Computing: Some curricula introduce basic robotics or physical computing (like using Micro:bit or Lego robotics kits) where students write code that makes a small device do something (e.g. turn on an LED light, move a robot). Computational Thinking: They engage in unplugged activities that foster logic and problem solving – e.g. solving puzzles, learning about binary numbers in a fun way, or debugging a pre-written program with errors. By the end of Grade 4, students should be comfortable with essential computer operations, know how to create and save work in different formats, and have written code that includes sequences, loops, and conditionals. They understand the importance of using technology safely and ethically. This sets the stage for more complex tasks in Grade 5, such as designing multi-step projects, using more advanced features of software, or diving deeper into how computers work."
4	Art & Design	No	"In Grade 4, art instruction often becomes more structured in teaching techniques while also encouraging individual expression. Drawing & Painting: Students learn about proportion in drawing more formally – for example, how to draw human faces or figures with correct proportions (using guidelines, understanding where eyes, nose, mouth generally align on a face). They practice perspective drawing: perhaps one-point perspective (drawing a road or railway tracks that converge at a point on the horizon) to create the illusion of depth. Color Theory: They might learn about warm vs. cool colors and how color can affect mood in artwork. They also explore mixing tertiary colors and complementary colors (and observe how opposite colors on the color wheel interact). Three-Dimensional Art: Projects could include sculpture with more detail – like using clay to sculpt a figure or an animal with attention to texture and form, or constructing something using mixed media (cardboard, wire, papier-mâché). They learn techniques for joining materials (using wire armatures, slots and tabs for cardboard, etc.). Printmaking & Design: Grade 4 may introduce printing techniques like linoleum block printing (with close teacher supervision) or more complex stamp making, which requires planning a mirror image and carving/pressing with care. They might also do textile arts such as simple embroidery or fabric dyeing (tie-dye) to learn pattern design. Art History & Critique: Students study art from different periods. For example, they might look at Renaissance art vs. Impressionist art and discuss differences in style (realistic vs. use of light and color). They could also explore Greek art history given context (like Classical column orders Doric/Ionic/Corinthian, or Byzantine mosaics) as part of cross-curricular learning with history. They learn to use art vocabulary: perspective, balance, contrast, emphasis, background/foreground, etc., to both describe and analyze artworks. They are encouraged to give constructive feedback to peers (e.g. “Your use of shading made the mountain look 3D, which is great. Maybe you could add more texture to the trees.”). Projects: By the end of Grade 4, students often undertake an extended art project that involves planning, drafting, and final execution (for example, designing a poster for a school event by sketching ideas, choosing the best, and creating a polished final poster). They demonstrate more independence and personal style in their art. Overall, Grade 4 art students can draw more realistically, employ perspective and shading, mix colors thoughtfully, and have an appreciation of various artistic styles and cultural art forms. They also show improved craftsmanship and the ability to follow through multi-step art tasks."
4	Music	No	"Grade 4 music brings more ensemble experience and theoretical knowledge. Theory: Students learn to read and use standard notation to a greater extent. They can read melodies on the treble clef that span an octave or more and understand rhythmic values down to sixteenth notes (semiquavers) perhaps. They learn about key signatures for simple keys (C major, G major with one sharp, F major with one flat, for instance) and the concept of a scale. Instrumental Performance: Many continue with recorder or start another melodic instrument (some schools introduce ukulele or keep using xylophones/glockenspiels). By the end of Grade 4, a recorder player might play songs that use 6-7 notes (covering most of the C-major scale). Ensemble work increases: they might have a class ensemble where some play recorder melody, others play chord accompaniment on xylophones, and some play rhythm on drums – coordinating three layers of music. Vocal Music: Students are able to sing in harmony in a simple choir setting. They might sing partner songs (two different songs that fit together), rounds in four parts, or easy two-part choral pieces (soprano/alto division among children). They work on breathing technique and diction so that lyrics are understandable. Their repertoire could include songs in other languages or more complex songs from musical plays, etc. Music Appreciation: Grade 4 might cover identifying instrument families (strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion) by sound, and they might attend or watch a concert (live or video) to see an orchestra in action. They could learn about famous composers (Beethoven, Mozart, etc.) and be able to recognize a famous piece or two (like Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” or Mozart’s “Eine kleine Nachtmusik”). Composition: Students may attempt composing a simple melody or ostinato of their own using notation. For example, they might write an 8-measure melody in C major using quarter and eighth notes, and perhaps even have a chance to perform or have it played by classmates. Technology in Music: If available, they might use basic music software or keyboards that show notation, to reinforce learning. By the end of Grade 4, students should be musically literate at an elementary level – they know note names, can keep time in common meters like 4/4 and 3/4, and can perform in an ensemble with awareness of others. They have greater confidence playing and singing and have begun to form opinions about music (expressing why they like a piece or how it makes them feel using musical vocabulary like “tempo” or “dynamics”)."
4	Physical Education (PE)	No	"In Grade 4, PE often starts resembling structured sports and advanced physical challenges. Team Sports: Students learn the rules and basic strategies of common sports (soccer, basketball, relay track events, etc.) and engage in modified game play. For example, in soccer, they practice dribbling, passing, shooting with more precision and then play scrimmage games on smaller fields. In basketball, they practice dribbling while moving, doing layups, and play 3-on-3 or 5-on-5 half-court games following simplified rules (no double-dribble, basic fouls). They learn positions conceptually (offense/defense) and the idea of teamwork (passing rather than just solo play). Advanced Motor Skills: Skills like dodging and feinting, hand-eye coordination for catching smaller/faster objects (tennis balls, flying discs), and foot-eye coordination (kicking a moving ball, juggling a soccer ball a couple of times) are developed. They might also try introductory track & field events like a 50m sprint, longer runs (maybe 400m, building endurance), long jump, or shot put (with light weights) to gauge and improve personal fitness. Gymnastics: In Grade 4, gymnastics tasks get more challenging: students might practice a sequence on a balance beam (low height) including walking, turning, small hops; they might learn a backward roll in addition to forward roll, attempt a handstand against a wall or a cartwheel unassisted if they haven’t before, and put together a floor routine (possibly in groups) with elements of tumbling, balances, and creative movement. Health & Fitness Knowledge: They learn about heart rate – maybe measuring their pulse after activity – and how regular exercise benefits the heart and muscles. They also talk about nutrition basics (identifying healthy vs. unhealthy snacks) and the importance of staying hydrated. Personal and Social Responsibility: At this age, students are often given more responsibility like leading a warm-up routine for the class, or being a team captain who helps organize teammates. They learn about fair play on a deeper level: respecting referees’ decisions, being gracious in defeat, and including everyone (no bullying in sports). They are also taught how to handle minor injuries (like what to do if you twist an ankle – rest, see teacher, etc.). By the end of Grade 4, children are more athletic: most can run a sustained longer distance (like 1 km) without walking, perform combinations of movements fluidly (like a run-and-jump for distance, or catching while on the move), and show good accuracy in throwing/kicking toward a target. They understand and can follow the rules of several sports and can function as part of a team, demonstrating cooperation and communication on the field. They’re developing a sense of sportsmanship and know how to win or lose with respect for others."
5	English (Literacy)	Yes	"In Grade 5 (Cambridge Stage 5), students refine their reading comprehension and writing styles, dealing with more complex texts and abstract language. Reading: Students now engage with idiomatic expressions and figurative language in their reading. They read novels appropriate for their age (often middle-grade novels with deeper themes), as well as a variety of texts like newspapers articles, persuasive essays, and poetry. They practice identifying the author’s purpose and viewpoint in a text. They analyze figurative language – for example, identifying similes and metaphors in a poem or story and discussing what they imply. They also might read and interpret simple personification in literature (e.g. “the wind whispered”). By year’s end, they should be comfortable inferring meaning and drawing conclusions from what they read (e.g. understanding character motivation that is implied but not stated). Writing: Grade 5 has students write for a variety of purposes – letters, reports, narratives, fables, playscripts, persuasive pieces. They are taught to tailor their writing style to the genre: e.g. a report should be objective and well-structured with headings, whereas a story can be creative and descriptive. They experiment with figurative language in their own writing – using metaphors or similes to make it more vivid (e.g. “The night was as quiet as an empty church”). They learn to write formal letters (like a letter to a principal or a business) with correct formatting, and persuasive essays where they present arguments with supporting points (e.g. convincing someone to protect the environment, including reasons and examples). They also continue developing narrative skills, possibly writing their own myth, mystery, or adventure story with well-developed plot and characters. Emphasis is placed on drafting, revising, and editing their work – they learn to critique their own writing and others’ constructively. Grammar and Mechanics: By Grade 5, students are expected to use advanced punctuation like quotation marks, commas for clauses, apostrophes for possession correctly. They also learn complex sentence structures – e.g. using subordinate clauses (“Although it was raining, we still went outside”) and ensuring subject-verb agreement in tricky cases (like with collective nouns or indeterminate pronouns). They gain more practice with direct vs indirect speech, perhaps even writing a short piece in each to see the difference. Spelling expectations include most words they commonly use and some challenge words; they learn about word origins, prefixes, and suffixes which helps in spelling and vocabulary. Speaking/Listening: Grade 5 students improve public speaking skills – they might do longer presentations (5 minutes), perhaps with visual aids, on research projects. They are taught to speak clearly, at a good pace, and to maintain audience interest (making eye contact, using expression). Group discussions are more sophisticated; students learn to build on each other’s ideas, disagree politely, and summarize points of consensus or contention. They also practice role-play or debates on topics (for instance, a classroom debate on a school issue like homework – learning to articulate arguments and rebuttals). Overall: By the end of Grade 5, students are approaching a secondary-school level of literacy. They can read complex texts and analyze literary devices. Their writing is more mature and varied, showing voice and effective organization. They can express and defend opinions, and they handle the English language with confidence across speaking, writing, and reading. This prepares them for the demands of Grade 6 and the Cambridge Checkpoint assessment that follows."
5	Mathematics	Yes	"Grade 5 mathematics (Cambridge Stage 5) solidifies advanced primary math skills and prepares students for secondary-level topics. Arithmetic and Calculator Use: By Grade 5, students become confident at using a calculator for complex calculations, but they are also trained to decide when it’s faster to calculate mentally or on paper vs. using a calculator. They routinely work with numbers up to at least 1,000,000 (one million), understanding place value to 6 or more digits. Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages: This is a major focus. Students learn to add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators (simple cases, like 1/2 + 1/3 by finding a common denominator of 6). They learn to multiply fractions by whole numbers (e.g. 3 × 2/5) and possibly start dividing whole numbers by simple fractions conceptually. They become fluent in converting fractions to decimals and vice versa (e.g. 3/4 = 0.75, 1/8 = 0.125). They also learn percentages and how they relate to fractions and decimals (e.g. 50% = 0.5 = 1/2). By year’s end, they solve problems involving finding a percentage of a quantity (like 20% of 150) either by fraction/decimal conversion or using ratio reasoning. Ratio and Proportion: Grade 5 introduces the concept of ratio – students might solve simple ratio problems (if 1 red bead to 2 blue beads is a ratio, how many blue in a set of 3 red?). They also use fractions to describe proportions (e.g. “1 out of 4” as a probability or ratio in simple contexts). Multiplication & Division: Students extend to multiplying larger numbers (up to 4-digit × 2-digit) and dividing larger numbers (up to 4-digit by 1 or 2-digit divisors). They practice long division with remainders and start interpreting remainders in word problems (e.g. when dividing 13 by 4, the answer can be 3 remainder 1, or 3.25, or “3 buses needed with 1 bus partially filled” depending on context). They also likely encounter prime numbers, prime factorization, and tests of divisibility (like by 3 or 9). Angles and Geometry: Students measure and draw angles with a protractor accurately, and learn properties of triangles (sum of angles = 180°) and quadrilaterals (sum of angles = 360°) – possibly proving these with paper folding or reasoning. They identify different types of triangles (acute, obtuse, right, equilateral, isosceles, scalene) and quadrilaterals (parallelogram, rhombus, trapezoid). They explore circles: maybe learn parts of a circle (radius, diameter, circumference) and the constant ? in a basic way (some curricula introduce circumference = ?d in 5th or 6th grade). Measurement: Conversions become more complex (like cm² to m² might be too advanced, but definitely converting between metric units in multistep problems, and maybe between metric and imperial if relevant). Volume of solids might be introduced (counting cubes, then the formula for volume of a rectangular prism = length×width×height). They also solve problems involving time (like elapsed time across AM/PM or durations in hours and minutes) with more ease. Geometry – Nets and Visualization: They continue working with 3D shapes and nets, possibly identifying nets for cubes, prisms, and pyramids, and visualizing 3D objects from 2D drawings. Data and Averages: Students handle more data – constructing and interpreting line graphs and more complex bar charts, maybe pie charts (circle graphs) conceptually via fractions of a circle. They learn the concept of mean (average) explicitly, and perhaps median and mode by arranging data. Probability might be introduced as basic chance (like probability of a coin toss = 1/2, etc.). By the end of Grade 5, students should be able to tackle multi-step real-world problems (e.g. involving calculations with money, such as finding the total cost after a percentage discount), logically choose operations, and justify their reasoning. They have integrated whole number operations with fractions, decimals, and percents, and they’ve built a strong foundation for algebraic thinking (though formal algebra might come in Grade 6). They are ready for more abstract math concepts and problem-solving at the Grade 6/Checkpoint level."
5	Science	Yes	"In Grade 5 science (Cambridge Stage 5), students explore more advanced topics and synthesize concepts across biology, chemistry, physics, earth science, etc. Biology – Plant Life Cycles: Students discover the full life cycle of plants in depth. They learn how flowering plants reproduce: pollination (transfer of pollen by insects or wind), fertilization (pollen meets ovule), seed formation and dispersal, and germination into new plants. They might dissect a flower (like a lily) to identify stamens, pistil, etc., and observe seeds. They also study plant propagation methods (how some plants grow from cuttings, etc.). Biology – Human & Animal Life Cycles: While plant life cycles are a focus, they may also revisit animal life cycles (e.g. life cycle of a frog, butterfly) and compare them. Possibly early puberty changes or human life stages are introduced at this age to prepare for health education (depending on curriculum). Earth & Space Science: Grade 5 often introduces astronomy. Students learn about the Earth’s rotation and revolution and how these cause day/night and seasons. They study the solar system – names and order of planets, basic characteristics of each (inner rocky vs. outer gas giants), and historical figures like Galileo or current space exploration. They learn the moon’s phases qualitatively and eclipses perhaps conceptually. They might also learn how the Earth’s rotation axis tilt causes seasons. The curriculum might include contributions of scientists who studied space (Galileo, Copernicus) to link science and history. Physics – Light: Light is often covered extensively in Grade 5. Students experiment with light: reflection (using mirrors, the law of reflection conceptually), refraction (bending of light in water or through prisms leading to rainbows). They learn that white light can split into colors (spectrum) and how lenses work (concave/convex basics, maybe building a simple telescope). Physics – Forces: Building on previous knowledge, they tackle more on forces such as gravity, and how it acts at a distance (they might learn acceleration due to gravity qualitatively and that it’s what causes things to fall). They examine forces in machines – perhaps simple machines (lever, pulley, inclined plane) to see how forces can be used to make work easier. Chemistry – States of Matter & Changes: They deepen understanding of changes of state by focusing on evaporation and condensation in detail (linking to the water cycle), and maybe boiling vs. evaporation differences. Solutions and mixtures are typically a Grade 5 topic: students learn what a solution is (salt in water), how some substances dissolve and others do not, and methods to separate mixtures (filtration, evaporation of water to get salt, etc.). This leads to understanding of reversible vs irreversible changes – burning and rusting are irreversible (new substances formed), dissolving or changing state are reversible (no new substance). Science Skills: Students plan and conduct more independent experiments. They identify variables (even if not using the term formally, they grasp changing one factor at a time). They take measurements with greater accuracy using appropriate instruments (e.g. measuring cylinder for volume, thermometer for temperature, stopwatch for time) and record them in tables. They begin to plot line graphs of their results where appropriate (especially for continuous data like temperature change over time). Importantly, they learn to use their results to make conclusions and also to say whether their results were what they expected or if something was anomalous. They might even suggest improvements to experiments. Scientific History & People: The curriculum often includes mention of famous scientists and their discoveries in context (like Newton for gravity/prisms, Galileo for astronomy, Marie Curie for radioactivity if touching atomic theory basics, etc.) to humanize science learning. By the end of Grade 5, students have a broad foundation in science: they understand life processes (particularly plant biology), Earth’s place in the solar system, foundational principles of light and matter, and have well-developed investigative skills. They are capable of linking concepts (like evaporation in both water cycle and separating solutions) and are prepared for the final stage of primary science which often synthesizes and reviews these topics with added complexity."
5	Global Perspectives (Cambridge)	No	"In Stage 5 Global Perspectives, students take greater initiative in identifying and researching issues of global importance, and their skill development in the six strands (research, analysis, evaluation, reflection, collaboration, communication) becomes more advanced. Project Work: A hallmark of Stage 5 is that students might undertake a sustained project over a few weeks. For example, a challenge could be “Rich and Poor” where they investigate differences in living standards. As part of this, a group might research access to clean water in different countries. Research: Students learn to formulate questions to guide their inquiry (e.g. “What are the causes of water scarcity and how does it affect children’s lives in different parts of the world?”). They use multiple sources – perhaps library books, interviews (e.g. asking a NGO worker or watching an interview online), and the internet – and learn to record information (taking notes, keeping track of sources). Analysis: They handle data like simple statistics or graphs about their topic and interpret what the data shows (e.g. creating a bar chart of different countries’ access to clean water and discussing which regions are most affected). Evaluation: A new emphasis at Stage 5 is evaluating sources and evidence. Students are taught to distinguish between fact and opinion and to consider whether a source is reliable or biased (for instance, they might compare information from a charity’s website vs. a random person’s blog). They learn to spot if the evidence supports an argument or if more information is needed. Collaboration: At this stage, groups might divide tasks (one student compiles survey data, another writes a summary, another prepares visuals) and then come back together, requiring good coordination. They often collaborate not just within their class but possibly with students in another school or country (some GP challenges encourage cross-cultural collaboration, perhaps via email or video chat, to exchange information). Communication: Students produce more polished outputs: maybe a written report with sections, or an oral presentation with a slideshow, or even a short video or skit to communicate their findings. They practice persuasive communication if their project involves advocating for something (like convincing others why conservation is needed). Reflection: By Grade 5, students thoughtfully reflect on what they have learned from their project about the issue and about working with others. They might write a short reflection or have a discussion on questions like “What was the biggest challenge in our research? What would we do differently next time? How has our view on this global issue changed?” Content: Topics in Stage 5 often get more complex – e.g. globalization, law and justice, sustainable living, etc., presented in an age-appropriate way. Students are encouraged to connect personal actions to global effects (like how their recycling or energy use relates to global environmental issues). By the end of Stage 5, students are much more adept at handling an inquiry from start to finish. They demonstrate critical thinking by not just gathering facts but questioning them. They can collaborate effectively, even negotiating differences in approach or opinion within their team. These skills set them up for the final primary stage, Stage 6, where they’ll do a Checkpoint assessment team project to showcase their Global Perspectives skills."
5	Computing / ICT	No	"Grade 5 computing often bridges the gap between simple coding and more structured programming, and between basic ICT skills and more sophisticated use of technology. Computer Science (Coding): Students may start using a text-based programming environment or a more complex block-based environment. If continuing with Scratch, they create more complex projects that might use variables for more purposes (counters, timers), conditionals with multiple cases, and possibly functions (custom blocks) to organize code. They might program simple simulations or games – for example, a quiz game that uses randomization, or an animation that responds to user inputs. Some curricula introduce Python or a similar text language at a basic level in Grade 5 or 6, to ease the transition to secondary school programming; thus Grade 5 could involve writing very simple Python scripts (like printing text, doing basic math, using loops to draw shapes with turtle graphics). Algorithms and Logical Thinking: Students learn to trace code and predict outcomes for moderately complex programs. They also learn about algorithm design more formally – perhaps using flowcharts or pseudocode to plan out a program’s logic before coding. Data and Spreadsheets: On the ICT side, Grade 5 might involve using spreadsheets to perform calculations and analyze data. Students can enter a data set and use formulas (like SUM, AVERAGE) to compute results, create charts from the data, and interpret them. This ties into math and science data handling. Internet and Information Literacy: By this age, students often undertake more independent online research for projects. They learn how search engines rank results, how to refine searches with quotes or keywords, and how to assess credibility of sites (looking at domain, author, date, etc.). They also discuss ethical/legal issues like plagiarism – learning to summarize and cite sources rather than copy-paste – and basic copyright (why we can’t just use any image we find, introduction to Creative Commons or fair use in simple terms). Digital Content Creation: Students might engage in a larger multimedia project, like creating a short documentary video or a website (using a kid-friendly website builder or simple HTML) about a topic. This integrates skills: writing a script, recording audio/video, editing (perhaps using basic video editing software), and publishing/presenting it. Or they might create a small website with multiple pages hyperlinked together to share information. Cybersecurity & Ethics: Grade 5 could introduce concepts of cyber safety beyond basics: like understanding computer viruses/malware and the importance of not downloading unknown files; discussing safe social media use (even if they are not of age, many know about it, so teaching about privacy settings, not sharing personal info/pictures with strangers, etc.); and positive digital footprint (what you post online can stay and impact you later). Possibly they also cover very basic coding of encryption (like making ciphers) to illustrate data protection ideas. By the end of Grade 5, students should be relatively independent and savvy technology users. They can choose the right software/tools to accomplish a task (e.g. using a slide presentation vs. a document vs. a video to present information), and they can write and debug programs at a beginner-intermediate level, showcasing logical reasoning. They’re aware of the broader impact of technology and their responsibilities as users (ethical and safe use). These competencies ensure they are well-prepared for the final primary year and beyond, where they might take on even more challenging computing tasks or integrate technology heavily in other subjects."
5	Art & Design	No	"In Grade 5, art students are on the verge of more advanced art-making and art appreciation, often producing work that is noticeably more skilled and personal. Advanced Techniques: Students refine techniques like shading (using cross-hatching, stippling for pen/pencil drawings), perspective (two-point perspective drawings of cubes, buildings, streets), and proportion (drawing from life – e.g. sketching a still life of simple objects or a basic figure drawing from a posed model or classmate). They learn to use grids or guidelines to help with scale and proportion in complex drawings. Mediums: They may explore new mediums like acrylic paints on canvas (learning about blending and layering), charcoal for value studies, or ink and calligraphy (which ties into fine motor control and design). Three-dimensional work could include ceramics – making pottery with proper techniques (pinch pots, coil pots, perhaps trying the potter’s wheel if available) and then glazing and firing them, which teaches planning (since glaze colors change after firing) and patience. Design and Composition: Grade 5 emphasizes thoughtful composition – students learn about the elements of art (line, shape, form, color, texture, space, value) and principles of design (balance, contrast, emphasis, movement, pattern, rhythm, unity) more formally, and are expected to apply them. For example, they might be tasked to create a balanced composition with a clear focal point, or use contrast of warm/cool colors effectively in a painting. Art History and Analysis: Students might do deeper studies of art movements. For example, they could study Impressionism (Monet, Degas) and then create an impressionist-style painting of their school garden, focusing on light and color. Or examine Renaissance art vs. Modern art differences. They might also look at Greek art more deeply if tied to history class (like studying Byzantine mosaics in Grade 5 history and then creating a paper mosaic, or learning about the Parthenon’s friezes and attempting bas-relief sculptures). Students practice writing or verbalizing their thoughts on art: by end of Grade 5 they might write a short paragraph analyzing an artwork, mentioning how the artist used color or what feeling the artwork gives and why. Collaborative and Portfolio Work: Some programs might have students engage in a collaborative mural or group art project in Grade 5, which teaches cooperation in art and collective design planning. Also, students often start building a portfolio of their best works, learning to select and present their artwork effectively (which pieces to include, how to mount or display them, etc.). Personal Expression: There’s encouragement of personal style – students might get more open-ended assignments where they choose the subject and medium to express a theme (like “change” or “dreams”), utilizing techniques they’ve learned. By the end of Grade 5, students can create artwork with a clear intent and fairly strong technical execution for their age. They can discuss art using proper terminology (identifying techniques and elements used) and show appreciation for various art styles and cultural art forms. They are essentially being groomed to approach art more like young artists – with planning, skill, and reflection – which sets them up for even more independent art creation in Grade 6 and beyond."
5	Music	No	"By Grade 5, students function akin to members of a school band or choir in miniature – their musical abilities are quite developed, and they delve into more sophisticated aspects of music. Instrumental Proficiency: If continuing recorder or another instrument, they now play songs spanning an octave plus a few notes (maybe low D to high D on recorder). In many schools, Grade 5 is when a band or string program might start; if so, students begin learning orchestral instruments (clarinet, trumpet, violin, etc.) and by year’s end can play basic scales and simple band pieces. For general class, they might use xylophones or keyboards to learn melodies with harmony (like playing chords on an accompaniment instrument while another group plays melody). Vocal Music: They can sing in two or three-part harmony consistently. The school choir, if any, often has its senior members in Grade 5/6 leading sections. They learn techniques such as breathing from the diaphragm, proper posture, and diction in foreign languages if singing Latin hymns or world songs. They might perform a choral arrangement with harmony and rounds integrated. Theory and Notation: Students understand key signatures and time signatures more deeply. They might identify the key of a piece (C major, G major, etc.) by the key signature. Rhythmically, they handle syncopation and more complex meters (6/8 time or change of meter). They could learn about scales beyond major – perhaps the minor scale (distinguishing its sound as “sadder”) or modes in the context of historical music. They also use notation creatively: composing short pieces (8-16 measures) for an instrument or ensemble and writing them correctly on staff paper, including dynamics and articulations (staccato, legato markings introduced). Music History & Appreciation: Grade 5 might cover historical periods of Western music (Baroque, Classical, Romantic, etc.) in overview – e.g. understanding that Bach was Baroque and the sound of a fugue vs. Mozart in Classical clarity vs. Beethoven’s Romantic emotion. They might also survey music from their own country’s history or from around the world – like studying Greek traditional music, identifying instruments like bouzouki, or learning a traditional dance song. They start to listen to longer works (maybe an entire short movement of a symphony or a simple opera story) and analyze structure (like ABA form, themes, motifs). Technology in Music: They might use simple composition software (like GarageBand or MuseScore) to create a multi-track piece, learning how layering works (e.g. record a drum loop, add a bass line, add a melody). Performance: By the end of Grade 5, students likely participate in a significant performance (like a school concert, musical or talent show), taking on more challenging pieces either instrumentally or vocally. They learn stage presence and ensemble discipline (following a conductor, entering and exiting stage formally, etc.). They might also do small group performances (trios, quartets) to cultivate independence from the teacher’s lead. Overall: Grade 5 musicians have a strong foundational theory knowledge, can perform with confidence in various settings, and have been exposed to a breadth of musical genres. They can critique music with understanding (e.g. “The tempo of this piece is very fast (allegro) which gives it a happy, energetic mood”). They are well-prepared for the final year of primary music, which often consolidates these skills and readies them for any specialized music endeavors in secondary school."
5	Physical Education (PE)	No	"Grade 5 PE often serves as a culmination of the skills learned so far, with students reaching a high level of proficiency in many movements and engaging in more competitive and endurance-based activities. Sports Competence: By Grade 5, students can play regulation games (modified for age) of various sports. They learn positions and strategies in team sports: for example, in soccer they understand positioning (defenders vs. forwards) and strategy (passing triangles, offside rule introduction); in basketball they practice set plays (simple pick-and-roll or inbound plays) and man-to-man or basic zone defense; in volleyball, they learn to serve underhand consistently and attempt three-hit play (bump, set, spike patterns) even if simplified. Many schools have interscholastic or intramural competitions around this age, so students might train for track and field events, swim meets, or team sports tournaments. Physical Fitness & Endurance: Students in Grade 5 work on endurance – e.g. running a mile (approximately 1.6 km) and timing it, then trying to improve; doing sustained aerobic activities like a 15-minute continuous game or jog. They might do fitness circuits with exercises like push-ups, sit-ups, burpees, and record their repetitions, seeing improvement over time. The concept of personal fitness goals is reinforced, possibly introducing fitness testing (like the beep test for running endurance, flexibility tests like sit-and-reach, etc.). Advanced Skills: Gymnastics might include linking moves into a routine on apparatus: e.g. doing a small sequence on a higher balance beam (walk, arabesque, small jump, dismount), or combining tumbling passes on floor (cartwheel into round-off). In dance, they might learn a full choreographed dance (possibly for a school performance) that includes different formations and more intricate steps (maybe a cultural dance with many steps or a modern hip-hop routine with synchronization). Health Education: Many programs integrate formal health ed in Grade 5. Topics can include the basics of human anatomy and changes during puberty (separating boys/girls for more sensitive discussions), nutrition in detail (understanding food groups, reading nutrition labels, what a balanced meal looks like), and introduction to harmful substances (why not to smoke, etc.). They also address personal health choices: sleep, stress management (maybe relaxation exercises or yoga introduced). Leadership and Teamwork: Grade 5 students are often given leadership opportunities in PE. They might lead warm-ups for the class, or be captains who not only play but help organize teams and mentor younger students (some schools have Grade 5 assist with Grade 1 events in sports days, for example). They are expected to exemplify sportsmanship and encourage their peers. Safety and Injury Prevention: They learn more about how to prevent and respond to injuries – e.g. RICE method (rest, ice, compression, elevation) for sprains, the importance of stretching and warm-up to prevent injury, and maybe an intro to first aid basics (like how to clean a small cut, why we need to hydrate to avoid heat exhaustion). By the end of Grade 5, students are quite athletic and understand how to maintain their physical fitness. They have a positive attitude toward physical activity, seeing it as both fun and important for health. They can compete fairly, handle wins and losses with maturity, and often identify one or two sports or activities they might want to continue with more seriously (setting the stage for either competitive sports or active hobbies in their teenage years). They also leave Grade 5 with knowledge on how their bodies work and how to care for them, which is crucial as they approach adolescence."
6	English (Literacy)	Yes	"Grade 6 (end of Cambridge Primary) expects students to be confident and proficient in English. Reading: Students can independently read and analyze a wide range of texts, including complex fiction (novels with nuanced themes) and nonfiction (articles, biographies, instructional texts). They are taught to comment on language and style in what they read. For instance, they can identify an author’s use of figurative language or specific tone and discuss how it affects the reader (e.g. recognizing humor, suspense, or persuasive techniques). They practice skills like summarizing chapters, drawing conclusions, and comparing texts. Poetry analysis might include inferring deeper meanings and discussing metaphor/symbolism. Writing: By the end of primary, students can write in various genres with clarity and voice. They learn to write a balanced argument or discussion essay, presenting two or more sides of an issue and concluding with their own stance. They also practice writing to persuade (e.g. a persuasive letter to a newspaper), to narrate (stories with well-developed characters and possibly twist endings), and to explain or inform (like a mini-research report with facts and logical structure). Emphasis is on organization (clear introductions and conclusions, appropriate paragraphing) and style (they are encouraged to develop a personal writing style, using a rich vocabulary and varying sentence structures for effect). Grammar & Mechanics: Students solidify their understanding of complex grammar. This includes correct and varied use of tenses, proper sequence of tenses in conditional sentences and reported speech, and nuanced punctuation (e.g. using commas to clarify meaning, semicolons for connected clauses, hyphens in compound adjectives, etc.). They learn to edit their work meticulously for spelling (including tricky words and uncommon vocabulary) and punctuation errors. They also practice editing for conciseness and eliminating ambiguity. Speaking/Listening: Grade 6 students are prepared to speak in more formal situations. They might engage in a class debate on a societal topic (e.g. technology’s impact on school life), employing rhetorical strategies and responding to opponents’ points. They may also do substantial presentations, perhaps accompanied by slides or other media, on cross-curricular projects (speaking for 5–10 minutes). They are expected to use persuasive and articulate speech – for instance, using rhetorical questions, varying tone for emphasis, and presenting arguments logically. In listening, they should be able to follow longer lectures or narratives and take notes or outline key points. Checkpoint Assessment: At the end of Grade 6, Cambridge Primary learners often take the Checkpoint exam in English, which assesses reading, writing, and language usage. Students have to demonstrate their skills in comprehension (answering questions on given passages, including inference and interpretation) and in writing (composing texts with audience and purpose in mind). Thus, by year’s end, they are exam-ready and confident in all areas of English. Overall: A Grade 6 student is essentially functioning at an early secondary level in English. They can analyze literature for themes and language, write effectively for different purposes, and speak or debate convincingly. They have a strong grasp of grammar and a wide-ranging vocabulary. These capabilities not only prepare them for secondary education but also make them well-equipped to use English across the curriculum and in everyday life as an articulate communicator."
6	Mathematics	Yes	"Grade 6 is the final year of primary and often aligns with Cambridge Primary Checkpoint exams. By this stage, students are applying all their arithmetic skills to problem-solving and getting introduced to early algebraic thinking and more advanced geometry. Problem-Solving Emphasis: There’s a strong emphasis on multi-step and word problems that require combining skills (e.g. a problem might involve percentages and geometry together). Students are taught to explain their reasoning clearly and even write down or present how they solved a complex problem. They tackle multi-step word problems regularly, often with extraneous information included to test their ability to discern relevant data. Advanced Arithmetic: By end of Grade 6, students can work fluently with whole numbers, fractions, decimals, and percentages interchangeably. They solve problems involving ratio and direct proportion (e.g. “If 3 pencils cost 90 cents, how much do 7 pencils cost?”). They understand rate concepts like speed = distance/time, or price rates, and can compute accordingly. Fractions/Decimals: They perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with fractions and decimals confidently (including division of fractions by fractions conceptually, which might be introduced, and division of decimals by decimals). Percentages: They find percentage increase or decrease (e.g. a price with 20% VAT added, or a sale with 15% off) and can compute percentages of quantities using either fraction/decimal methods or proportion. Algebra Introduction: Students likely get introduced to basic algebraic expressions and simple equations. For example, using a letter to represent an unknown in equations like 4x + 5 = 25 and solving for x, or figuring out the formula for a pattern. They might learn to simplify expressions (like 2a + 3a = 5a) and evaluate expressions for given values. Some curricula introduce the concept of a linear function graphically (very basic plotting of y = 2x, etc., to see a line). Geometry: Students now handle more complex geometry. They calculate area and perimeter for various shapes (triangles, parallelograms, trapezoids, possibly circles introduction), and volume of rectangular prisms (with understanding of cubic units). They apply the formula for area of a triangle (1/2 * base * height) and parallelogram (base * height) etc. They study angles in polygons, knowing sums of interior angles (like sum of angles in triangle = 180°, quadrilateral = 360°) and use that to find unknown angles. They learn properties of circles: understanding radius, diameter (d = 2r), perhaps the number ? for circumference and area (though often the actual formula usage for area of circle is left for secondary, they might explore ? via measuring circumferences). Graphing and Coordinates: By Grade 6, students can plot points on a coordinate plane (all four quadrants or just first quadrant depending on curriculum). They might plot simple linear relationships or shapes on coordinate grids. They also interpret and draw line graphs for data and understand trends. Possibly introduction to pie charts by constructing them given data and fractions of 360°. Statistics: They calculate mean, median, mode, and range for data sets and interpret what these tell about the data. Possibly simple probability (like probability of an event = favorable outcomes/total outcomes) is taught, along with experiments (like rolling dice frequencies) to compare theoretical and experimental probability. Checkpoint Prep: The Cambridge Checkpoint tests (if taken) will assess number skills, geometry, data, and problem-solving in a balanced way. Students practice past papers or similar comprehensive tests, which require showing work clearly. Therefore, by year’s end they are not only capable of solving Grade 6 problems but also justify and communicate their solutions logically. Overall: A Grade 6 student will have mastered primary mathematics: they can perform complex calculations (often even without a calculator unless allowed), reason logically through new problems, and connect different math concepts together. They are comfortable with abstract ideas (like using symbols in algebra) and have a solid groundwork for secondary mathematics such as algebra, geometry, and beyond. They also learn to check the reasonableness of their answers and approach problems systematically, explaining steps – an important skill for higher-level math."
6	Science	Yes	"Grade 6 science completes the primary science curriculum, often revisiting key topics with greater depth and ensuring students can analyze and discuss scientific ideas with confidence. Scientific Inquiry & Checkpoint: By the end of Grade 6, students are skilled in planning and conducting experiments, recording observations accurately, and drawing conclusions justified by their data. They learn to explain whether results support a hypothesis and to consider improvements or further questions. They also practice interpreting data from tables/graphs and explaining trends or anomalies. As part of Cambridge Primary Checkpoint, they may tackle questions requiring application of concepts to new situations, so the focus is on understanding over memorization. Biology – Ecosystems and Environment: Students look at the broader picture of living things. They study food chains and food webs in an ecosystem, learning terms like producer, consumer (herbivore, carnivore, omnivore), decomposer. They explore how changes in an environment (like pollution or removal of one species) affect the whole food web. Human impact on the environment is a key topic: they discuss positive and negative ways humans affect ecosystems (deforestation, pollution vs. conservation efforts). They might also cover basic ecological concepts like habitats, niches, and adaptation revisited (from earlier grades) in context of environment. Biology – Human Biology: Grade 6 often includes human biology and health. Students learn about the major body systems (circulatory, respiratory, digestive, excretory, nervous, etc.) and their primary functions. They might trace what happens when we eat food (digestive process), or how the heart and lungs work together (circulation of blood and oxygen). They learn more about puberty and reproduction in humans – changes in boys and girls (usually in a health class context, but also science), and the basics of how a baby is conceived and develops (depending on the curriculum’s approach to sex education). Chemistry – Material Changes: Students concentrate on advanced properties of materials and changes. They study reversible vs. irreversible changes clearly – melting/freezing, evaporating/condensing (reversible, physical changes) vs. burning, rusting (chemical changes that form new substances). They may do experiments like burning a candle to see both physical (melting) and chemical (wick burning to ash) changes. They also learn about mixtures and solutions thoroughly: methods of separation like filtration, distillation (conceptually), crystallization. Possibly an intro to the concept of atoms and particles: some primary curricula introduce a simple particle model (solids, liquids, gases differences explained by particle arrangement) and the idea that in chemical changes particles rearrange to form new substances. Physics – Electricity and Circuits: Grade 6 builds on circuits: students might learn to draw circuit diagrams with standard symbols (battery, switch, bulb, resistor). They explore series vs parallel circuits differences (e.g. in parallel, if one bulb breaks others stay on, whereas in series they all go out). They may measure current or understand what current is qualitatively. Possibly introduction of terms voltage and resistance in a basic way (e.g. more batteries = brighter bulb because higher voltage; adding more bulbs in series = dimmer because more resistance). These set the stage for secondary physics. Physics – Energy: Students learn about different forms of energy (kinetic, potential, heat, light, electrical, chemical, etc.) and energy transformations (like in a flashlight: chemical -> electrical -> light + heat). They discuss conservation of energy conceptually (energy is not lost, it changes form) and why some energy conversions are inefficient (usually producing heat “waste”). Renewable and nonrenewable energy sources might be covered (solar, wind vs coal, oil). Physics – Advanced Forces: They may revisit forces with quantitative aspects: for example, measuring forces with a spring scale (Newton meter), understanding weight vs mass (weight is a force due to gravity). They might do experiments on falling objects or simple pendulums to see gravity’s effect. Also friction, air resistance, and how streamlining works could be experimented with (like making parachutes or paper spinners). Light and Sound: Often revisited in Grade 6 with more quantification – e.g. measuring angles of incidence/reflection in a mirror to see they’re equal, or using prisms to talk about visible spectrum and perhaps basics of color addition (primary colors of light vs pigment). Sound might include understanding vibrations in more depth – seeing oscilloscope traces or using a simulation to see waveforms for loud/soft or high/low sounds. Earth and Space: If not thoroughly done in Grade 5, Grade 6 ensures understanding of the Earth-Moon-Sun system (phases of the Moon, eclipses, seasons, time zones), and perhaps a bit on the planets or beyond (galaxies, etc.) as enrichment. Scientific Perspective: There’s often a nod to the nature of science – how scientific ideas are tested and either accepted or modified over time (like how our model of the solar system changed from geocentric to heliocentric, or how theories like continental drift became plate tectonics). By the end of Grade 6, students are well-versed in essential scientific principles across disciplines and can think critically about scientific problems. They are assessed via Cambridge Primary Checkpoint in science, which evaluates their understanding and application across these topics. They should be able to discuss and reason – for example, explain why a certain experimental result happened using concepts (not just state that it did). They also have an increased awareness of how science relates to society and the environment (e.g. energy choices, human health, environmental conservation). Overall, they are ready to embark on specialized sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Physics) in secondary school with a strong foundational knowledge base and investigative skill set."
6	Global Perspectives (Cambridge)	No	"In Stage 6 (Grade 6) Global Perspectives, students culminate their primary GP experience with advanced projects and a Cambridge Primary Checkpoint assessment that typically involves a team project. Skill Mastery: By now, they are expected to seamlessly use all GP skills – research, analysis, evaluation, reflection, collaboration, and communication – at a primary-exit level, meaning they can handle a project almost like lower-secondary students. Team Project for Assessment: One key component is a Team Project assessed by Cambridge (or internally): students work in groups to identify a global topic of interest, plan an investigation, carry it out, and then produce a team report or presentation. For example, they might choose “Accessibility in Sports” (echoing the sample challenge Cambridge provides: “How can sport be more accessible?”). They would then research issues that people with disabilities face in sports both locally and globally, maybe interview a local athlete with a disability or a coach, compare how accessible sports facilities are in different countries, and then propose solutions or raise awareness. They have to show how they divided tasks, synthesized information, and came to a collaborative outcome. Research & Analysis: Stage 6 students formulate more nuanced questions and possibly use secondary data or simple primary data (like creating and distributing a questionnaire). They handle comparing multiple sources of information and can highlight agreements or contradictions between sources. They analyze data for patterns and are capable of calculating simple statistics or percentages if needed to support their analysis. Evaluation: At this stage, students consciously evaluate the reliability of sources (author’s credentials, potential bias) and the validity of their data (did we ask enough people, is our sample biased?). They might also evaluate each other’s arguments in discussions (e.g. “Do we have evidence for that claim?”). Reflection: Individually and as a group, Stage 6 learners reflect on what they have learned about the topic and about the process of working together. They consider the global perspective they gained: e.g. “We used to think this was only a problem in our community, but now we see it’s an issue worldwide, though handled differently in X country.” They also reflect on their own contributions and skills developed (like saying “I learned how to better organize tasks and that listening to everyone’s ideas first helped our project”). Communication: They produce a well-structured report or presentation for their project, often including visuals like charts, or possibly a short video or PowerPoint. For Checkpoint, often it’s a team presentation that is marked – they need to communicate their findings clearly, each member speaking, possibly followed by a Q&A where they must defend or elaborate on their work. They use appropriate terminology and try to engage the audience (maybe through rhetorical questions or a demo). Topics: Stage 6 topics could be quite sophisticated: global health issues, climate change effects, digital technology’s impact, cultural heritage preservation – as examples. Students are encouraged to consider personal, local, and global perspectives explicitly: how does this issue affect me or my community, and how does it play out in other parts of the world? They compare and contrast these perspectives. By the end of Grade 6, through Global Perspectives, students have developed into globally aware, critical thinkers. They can investigate an issue that doesn’t have a straightforward answer, appreciate multiple viewpoints, and work effectively in a team to propose informed opinions or solutions. The skills they have honed – from research techniques to teamwork and self-evaluation – prepare them not only for secondary education projects across subjects but also for responsible citizenship in an interconnected world."
6	Computing / ICT	No	"Grade 6 computing wraps up primary ICT and computer science education, ensuring students are ready for the secondary level (where they might encounter more formal ICT classes or even start on IGCSE Computing in some cases). Programming: By the end of Grade 6, students have likely been introduced to text-based coding (if not in Grade 5, certainly in Grade 6 for many curricula). They can write simple programs in a language like Python or JavaScript to accomplish basic tasks: e.g., a program that asks the user for their age and prints a message, or one that calculates areas of shapes based on input. They understand variables, can perform arithmetic and string operations, use loops (for, while) and if-else conditions with competence. They might also use lists/arrays or dictionaries in a basic way (perhaps making a list of numbers and finding the average via a loop). Problem Solving and Algorithms: Students are taught to approach problems methodically: they can break down a task into smaller steps (decomposition), design an algorithm (maybe in pseudocode or flowchart form) before coding, and test/debug systematically (finding errors, using print statements or logical reasoning to locate bugs). A possible assignment is coding a simple game (like a number guessing game, or text-based adventure) which brings these elements together. Computational Thinking: Concepts like pattern recognition and abstraction are reinforced – for instance, solving a general problem by finding a pattern or using a function (they might define simple functions to reuse code). They may also tackle exercises that involve logic puzzles or binary number basics (like converting small numbers to binary and understanding how computers use binary). Web and Multimedia: On the ICT side, Grade 6 students may create more sophisticated digital content. For example, they might create a personal or class webpage using HTML/CSS (learning basic tags for headings, paragraphs, images, links, and some styling). Or use an authoring tool to make an interactive quiz or story (combining text, images, maybe audio – akin to a simple HyperCard/PowerPoint but with hyperlinks and branching). Office/Productivity Software: They likely have mastery of word processors (including use of tables, text wrapping, maybe references or track changes for peer editing), spreadsheets (can do more complex formulas, maybe conditional formatting or simple charts, and understand modeling by changing variables in a spreadsheet to see outcomes), and presentation software (using slide transitions, embedding video, etc.). They might also use database basics if included (setting up a simple database file and running queries, or understanding what a database is used for). Digital Citizenship and Safety: By Grade 6, students are often using the internet more independently. They learn about social media etiquette, consequences of cyberbullying (and how to respond/report it), and managing their digital footprint (realizing that what they post could remain accessible). Discussions about verifying information in the age of “fake news” may be included – teaching them to check multiple sources or use fact-checking sites. Security: They are taught about common threats – viruses, malware, phishing emails – in more detail, and how to protect their personal data (strong passwords, not sharing passwords, understanding privacy settings). Some may learn how to set up basic virus scan or be aware of not clicking unknown attachments. Ethics: They discuss ethical issues like plagiarism (especially as their research projects intensify – ensuring they cite sources and not copy), and intellectual property (why piracy or copying software/music is illegal, fair use concepts). Emerging Tech: They might be introduced to emerging technologies concepts – e.g., the idea of AI (perhaps coding a simple logic in Scratch that mimics AI decision-making), or robotics (maybe programming a LEGO Mindstorms robot to do a task, integrating engineering and coding). By the end of Grade 6, students should be technology fluent: capable of picking up new software quickly, using the computer as a tool across subjects, and writing basic programs to automate tasks or solve problems. They should also be responsible users who understand the potential and pitfalls of technology use. These competencies enable them to confidently start secondary ICT/computer science courses and also to leverage ICT for their learning in all areas (presenting, analyzing data, researching, etc.)."
6	Art & Design	No	"Grade 6 art often serves as a capstone for primary art education, consolidating skills and pushing students toward independent, expressive projects. Portfolio and Exhibition: Many schools have Grade 6 students prepare an art portfolio of their best works or put on an art exhibition. This means by year’s end, each student should have a few accomplished pieces (drawings, paintings, 3D works, etc.) that show a range of skills and personal expression. They learn to curate their work (selecting pieces, mounting/framing if needed, writing artist statements about their work to display). Advanced Techniques & Media: Grade 6 students experiment with advanced media or combinations. They might do oil painting on canvas (or acrylic with techniques mimicking oil), including how to blend and build texture, or advanced watercolor techniques like washes and masking for highlights. In drawing, they could attempt more challenging subjects like perspective interiors or streetscapes with multiple vanishing points, drawing from life such as a detailed still life arrangement with correct shading and cast shadows, or even life drawing of a classmate in various poses (with swimwear or sportswear for modesty) focusing on proportion and form. Printmaking could be revisited with multi-color prints (using reduction printing or multiple blocks for layers of color). Sculpture: They might engage in a more complex sculpture project, such as carving soapstone/soft stone, or creating a wire sculpture of a figure capturing movement (like an athlete in motion), or a mixed-media assemblage sculpture that incorporates found objects with a theme (introducing a bit of contemporary art style). Design: Graphic design elements may be introduced. For instance, designing a logo, a book cover, or a poster for an event (synthesizing visual communication skills and possibly using computer software like a basic Photoshop or online design tool). This ties art with technology and real-world application. Art History & Cultural Art:"
6	Music	No	"Grade 6 music often represents the peak of primary music proficiency, and in some cases, it transitions students into more formal ensembles or music theory if they pursue it in secondary. Ensemble Performance: By Grade 6, many students participate in a school band, orchestra, or choir at a level where they perform multi-part music publicly. Instrumentalists can play pieces together in harmony – e.g. a band piece with flute, clarinet, trumpet, percussion parts – reading their individual lines and maintaining their part in harmony with others. If the school doesn’t have a band program, class music may simulate it with Orff ensembles (xylophones of different sizes, recorders, percussion each playing different lines). The choir likely performs 3-part or 4-part arrangements (Soprano/Alto/ maybe Tenor range for changed voices or some boys may start changing). They refine their singing technique – focusing on blend, vowel uniformity, more advanced dynamics (crescendos, sudden pianissimo, etc.). Theory & Musicianship: Students often take a music theory assessment or final exam at this stage. They can identify key signatures up to 2 or 3 sharps/flats, know all note values (including dotted notes, triplets perhaps), and can read and write music on treble and bass clefs to a basic extent (bass clef at least to identify instruments or if playing an instrument like cello, though not all curricula do bass clef for every student). They understand scales (major scales, maybe natural minor) and possibly are introduced to the concept of chords (the I, IV, V chords in a key). Ear training by Grade 6 might include recognizing intervals (like unison, 4th, 5th, octave by ear), identifying a simple major vs minor chord by listening, and clapping back a heard rhythm pattern in 4/4 or 3/4 with syncopations. Composition: Many programs have students do a small composition project. For example, using their theory knowledge, they might compose a short melody with accompaniment (perhaps in a notation software) – 8 bars of melody with chord symbols or a simple left-hand part if on keyboard – and maybe perform it or have it performed. Or writing lyrics and setting them to an original tune (often integrated with language arts). They are encouraged to use dynamics and expression marks in their written music. Exposure to Advanced Music: Students listen to more sophisticated works: perhaps a full movement of a symphony, an opera aria, or a modern piece. They discuss form (like identifying ABA form or rondo form in what they hear, or noticing how a theme is developed). If available, they might attend a live concert of a youth orchestra or professional one for inspiration. Music and Technology: Where resources permit, students might use music software to create multi-track recordings (e.g. record their own beat, then add a melody on MIDI keyboard, etc.) or learn basic audio editing. They also discuss how technology has changed music consumption (streaming, etc.) and creation (electronic music, autotune, etc.), linking to media literacy. Cultural and Historical Perspective: By Grade 6, they cover some music history – possibly a quick journey through Western music periods, identifying characteristics (Baroque’s ornate melodies, Classical’s clarity, Romantic’s emotion) and tying in composers (Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, etc.). They also look at Greek music heritage given local context – perhaps learning a traditional folk song or a rebetiko song, identifying traditional instruments like bouzouki or lyra, especially if not covered earlier. World music exploration could include trying instruments from other cultures or learning a non-European song. Final Performance: Often, the culmination is a graduation performance or musical production where Grade 6 showcases their talents – singing a graduation song, or performing in an end-of-year musical, etc. By the end of Grade 6, students can be considered well-rounded young musicians. Even those who don’t pursue formal music in secondary school will have the ability to read music at a basic level, an appreciation for various musical genres, and the confidence to perform or speak about music. Those who do continue have a strong foundation in theory, performance, and ensemble skills, setting them up for band, choir, or more specialized music studies (like instrument lessons, etc.) in the future. They also carry with them important soft skills like teamwork, discipline from practicing, listening and responding in a group – all fostered through their musical journey."
6	Physical Education (PE)	No	"By Grade 6, students are at the top of the primary school and often serve as role models in sports and physical leadership. The PE program aims to consolidate their physical skills, instill lifelong fitness habits, and perhaps introduce a few new challenges to keep engagement high. Sports Mastery and Competition: Grade 6 students usually compete at the highest level offered in primary – inter-school tournaments or school-wide competitions (like an upper primary sports day where they lead teams). They exhibit advanced understanding of games: in soccer, for example, they execute formations and strategies, understand positions deeply, and demonstrate skills like accurate passing, strategic dribbling, and proper shooting technique. In basketball, they can play full-court 5v5 games, executing plays and showing defensive/offensive switches. They might also try more advanced sports if available: like an introduction to volleyball 6-a-side with rotations and proper serving/setting/spiking technique, or track events like hurdles, or field events like shot put or discus with appropriate junior weights. Leadership in PE: Students often are given responsibilities such as refereeing a younger class’s game (learning the rules well enough to officiate fairly), leading warm-up/stretching routines for the whole group, or even organizing a portion of a sports event (like managing equipment or score-keeping). This builds leadership and organizational skills. Physical Fitness & Testing: Many schools do a formal fitness assessment in Grade 6 (e.g. based on the Eurofit or Presidential Fitness standards). Students might do timed runs (e.g. a 1-mile run), push-up/sit-up counts, sit-and-reach flexibility, and sprint times. They compare their results to previous years, set goals, and see their progress. The concept of personal fitness plans might be introduced – students could create a simple workout schedule or set a goal (like “improve my push-ups from 5 to 15 in 2 months”) and track it. Health Education: Typically, puberty and personal health are thoroughly addressed either in Grade 5 or 6. By Grade 6, any remaining topics like the reproductive system, substance abuse dangers (smoking, alcohol, drugs), and mental health basics (coping with stress, importance of sleep) are covered in an age-appropriate way. They also learn about first aid more concretely – maybe how to treat a nosebleed, how to clean and bandage a cut, and the importance of emergency numbers and what to do in emergencies (some schools might even teach CPR basics or at least demonstration by professionals). New Physical Activities: To broaden horizons, Grade 6 might introduce alternative physical activities that could be pursued lifelong: such as yoga (for flexibility and stress relief), orienteering (using maps/compass for a physical treasure hunt), cycling safety and skills (if possible), or even basic self-defense moves. They may also discuss and try fitness trends (like aerobics, circuit training, or dance fitness classes) to show exercise isn’t just sports – it can be recreational physical activities too. Teamwork and Sportsmanship Refined: Teachers emphasize that as the oldest students, Grade 6 should demonstrate exemplary sportsmanship: encouraging younger ones, playing fair, being humble in victory and gracious in defeat. They might mentor younger teams or buddies in a sports “buddy system.” Transition to Secondary: Some discussion on how sports/PE will be in high school and encouraging them to consider joining teams or staying active outside of school (like community sports clubs, etc.) is common – planting the seed for continued physical activity beyond primary. By the end of Grade 6, students are generally physically competent and confident. They have learned a wide repertoire of sports and activities and can find those they enjoy most. They understand how to maintain their fitness and why it’s important. They also carry forward leadership qualities and teamwork learned on the field. Ideally, they leave primary school with a positive attitude toward physical activity and a toolkit of skills and knowledge to lead a healthy lifestyle and participate in sports or exercise in the future."
