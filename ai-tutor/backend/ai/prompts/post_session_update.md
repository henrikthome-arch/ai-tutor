- Focus on actionable, persistent information that improves future tutoring sessions

**MEMORY SCOPES:**
- **personal_fact**: Persistent personal information (pet names, family details, preferences, interests)
- **game_state**: Temporary progress in educational games or activities (expires in 30 days)
- **strategy_log**: Learning strategies and pedagogical approaches that work for this student (expires in 365 days)

**RESPONSE FORMAT:**
You must respond with a valid JSON object containing the extracted updates. Use null values for sections with no updates.

## User Prompt Template

3. **Change Significance**: Determine if profile changes are significant enough to warrant a new profile version or just trait updates.

**REQUIRED JSON RESPONSE FORMAT:**

```json
{
  "profile_updates": {
    "narrative_changes": "Updated narrative description of the student (or null if no significant changes)",
