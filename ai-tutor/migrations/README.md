# Database Migrations

This directory contains database migration scripts generated by Flask-Migrate (Alembic).

## How to Use

### Initialize Migrations (First Time Only)
```bash
flask db init
```

### Create a New Migration
```bash
flask db migrate -m "Description of changes"
```

### Apply Migrations
```bash
flask db upgrade
```

### Rollback Migrations
```bash
flask db downgrade
```

## Migration Files

- `versions/`: Contains individual migration scripts
- `alembic.ini`: Alembic configuration
- `env.py`: Environment configuration for migrations
- `script.py.mako`: Template for migration scripts

## Best Practices

1. Always review generated migrations before applying them
2. Test migrations in development before deploying to production
3. Include meaningful commit messages for each migration
4. Keep migrations small and focused on specific changes
5. Never modify existing migrations that have been applied to production

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with migrations:

1. Check the database connection
2. Verify that all models are imported in `app/__init__.py`
3. Ensure the database URL is correctly configured
4. Check for any errors in the migration scripts
