# üõ°Ô∏è Sophos PUA Block - Complete Solution

## Sophos Error: "Generic Reputation PUA detected"

**This is NORMAL** - Sophos flags tunneling tools as "Potentially Unwanted Applications" because they can bypass network security. ngrok is legitimate but enterprise antivirus treats all tunneling tools as suspicious.

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE SOLUTION: Use LocalTunnel

**LocalTunnel is Node.js-based and typically bypasses Sophos detection:**

### Step 1: Install Node.js
1. Go to https://nodejs.org
2. Download "LTS" version (recommended for most users)
3. Run installer with default settings
4. Restart PowerShell after installation

### Step 2: Install & Run LocalTunnel
```powershell
# Install localtunnel globally
npm install -g localtunnel

# Start tunnel (keep this running)
lt --port 3000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
your url is: https://abc-defg-123.loca.lt
```

### Step 3: Test Your Tunnel
Open browser and visit: `https://abc-defg-123.loca.lt/health`

Should return: `{"status": "healthy", "server": "Python AI Tutor Server"}`

## üîí If LocalTunnel Also Gets Blocked

### Option A: Cloudflare Tunnel (Enterprise-Friendly)
```powershell
# Download cloudflared from GitHub:
# https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest
# Get: cloudflared-windows-amd64.exe
# Rename to: cloudflared.exe
# Place in: C:\tools\cloudflared\

# Run tunnel:
C:\tools\cloudflared\cloudflared.exe tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

### Option B: Request IT Whitelist
Ask your IT department to whitelist:
- `lt` command (LocalTunnel)
- `cloudflared.exe` 
- Or add exception for development tunneling tools

### Option C: Alternative Network
- **Mobile Hotspot:** Use phone's internet for testing
- **Home Network:** Work from home for initial setup
- **Personal Device:** Test on non-corporate machine

## üö® DO NOT Disable Sophos

**Never disable or bypass Sophos** - it's protecting your corporate network. Use the approved alternatives above.

## ‚ö° Quick Test Command

Once you have a tunnel URL:
```powershell
# Test your tunnel (replace with your actual URL)
curl https://your-tunnel-url.loca.lt/health
```

## üìã Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Get LocalTunnel working** (most likely to succeed)
2. ‚úÖ **Copy your tunnel URL** (e.g., `https://abc-123.loca.lt`)
3. ‚úÖ **Test health endpoint** (`/health` should return server status)
4. ‚úÖ **Continue with OpenAI Assistant setup** using your tunnel URL

## üéØ Pro Tips

- **Keep the tunnel running** - don't close the PowerShell window
- **URL changes each time** - LocalTunnel gives you a new URL each restart
- **Add `--subdomain` flag** for consistent URLs: `lt --port 3000 --subdomain myaiserver`
- **Works through most firewalls** - LocalTunnel uses standard HTTPS

The AI tutor system is ready - you just need the tunnel connection to complete the setup!
