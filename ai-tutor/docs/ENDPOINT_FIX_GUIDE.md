# 🔧 404 Error Fix - GET Endpoint Support

## ✅ Issue Identified and Fixed

**Problem:** `https://ai-tutor-ptnl.onrender.com/mcp/get-student-context?student_id=emma_smith` returned 404

**Root Cause:** The endpoint was only configured for POST requests with JSON body, not GET requests with query parameters.

---

## 🛠️ Fix Applied

**Updated [`simple-server-fixed.py`](simple-server-fixed.py)** to support both:

### ✅ GET with Query Parameters (Browser-friendly)
```
GET https://ai-tutor-ptnl.onrender.com/mcp/get-student-context?student_id=emma_smith
```

### ✅ POST with JSON Body (API-friendly)
```
POST https://ai-tutor-ptnl.onrender.com/mcp/get-student-context
Content-Type: application/json

{"student_id": "emma_smith"}
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment Process

1. **✅ Fix committed** to GitHub
2. **🔄 Git push in progress** (automatic deployment trigger)
3. **⏳ Render.com auto-deployment** (2-3 minutes after push)
4. **✅ Endpoint will work** after redeployment

---

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

**Wait 2-3 minutes for Render to redeploy, then test:**

### Health Check (Should work immediately)
```
https://ai-tutor-ptnl.onrender.com/health
Expected: {"status": "healthy", "server": "Python AI Tutor Server"}
```

### Student Data (Will work after fix deploys)
```
https://ai-tutor-ptnl.onrender.com/mcp/get-student-context?student_id=emma_smith
Expected: Complete Emma Smith profile and progress data
```

---

## 📋 What the Fix Does

**Before:** Only POST endpoint
```python
def do_POST(self):
    if parsed_path.path == '/mcp/get-student-context':
        # Only worked with JSON body
```

**After:** Both GET and POST
```python
def do_GET(self):
    elif parsed_path.path == '/mcp/get-student-context':
        # Handle GET with query parameters
        query_params = parse_qs(parsed_path.query)
        student_id = query_params.get('student_id', [None])[0]
        # Now works with ?student_id=emma_smith
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Timeline

- **0-2 minutes:** Git push completes
- **2-5 minutes:** Render.com automatic redeployment
- **5+ minutes:** Fixed endpoint should work in browser

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

1. **Check Render.com dashboard** - Should show "Deploy in progress" then "Live"
2. **Test health endpoint** - Should return server status
3. **Test student endpoint** - Should return Emma's data
4. **Proceed with OpenAI Assistant setup** once endpoints work

Your AI tutor system will be fully operational once this deployment completes!
