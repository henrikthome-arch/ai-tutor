# 🎙️ VAPI MCP Integration Guide - Phone-Based AI Tutor

## ✅ **Perfect! Our MCP Server is Ready for VAPI**

You're absolutely correct - we don't need OpenAI Assistant. VAPI will discover our MCP tools automatically and make them available to the LLM during calls.

## 🔄 **Correct Integration Flow**

```
Caller → VAPI → LLM (with auto-discovered MCP tools) → Our MCP Server → Student Context → Response
```

### **What We Already Have:**
- ✅ **MCP Server**: `session-enhanced-server.py` with `get-student-context` tool

## 📞 **Test Phone Number Available**

**VAPI Test Number**: `+1 (539) 589-2719`
**SIP Address**: `sip:ai-tutor-by-henrik@sip.vapi.ai`
**Assistant Name**: `Henrik Experiment - AI tutor`

You can call this number or use the SIP address to test the AI tutor system once the MCP integration is complete.

- ✅ **Phone Support**: Tool accepts `phone_number` parameter  
- ✅ **Phone Mapping**: `PhoneMappingManager` for student lookup
- ✅ **Test Results**: All phone scenarios working locally

## 📋 **VAPI Setup Steps**

### 1. **Deploy MCP Server to Render.com**
```bash
# Our server is ready - just deploy it
git push origin main  # Already done ✅
# Render.com will auto-deploy from GitHub
```

### 2. **Add MCP Tool in VAPI Dashboard**
1. Go to **VAPI Dashboard → Tools → Create Tool → MCP**
2. **Server URL**: `https://ai-tutor-ptnl.onrender.com/mcp`
3. **Name**: `ai-tutor-mcp` (alphanumeric, underscores, hyphens only)
4. **Save and Publish**

VAPI will automatically discover our `get-student-context` tool from the `/mcp/tools` endpoint.

### 3. **Simple VAPI Prompt** (No Function Calling Instructions)
```
You are a multi-lingual AI tutor that is excellent at inspiring children to learn and nurturing their curiosity.

At the start of each call, look up the student using their phone number ({{customer.number}}) with the get_student_context tool.

IF STUDENT IS UNKNOWN:
This is your FIRST CONTACT with a new child. Learn about them:
- Name, age, and grade level
- Interests, hobbies, and passions  
- Personality and learning preferences
- What motivates them and gets their attention
- Favorite and least favorite subjects

Keep questions open-ended. Mirror answers. Confirm understanding. If uninterested, switch approaches. End warmly saying you'll see them tomorrow.

IF STUDENT IS KNOWN:
Provide personalized tutoring using their profile:
- Greet by name and reference their interests
- Connect learning to what they love
- Use their preferred learning style
- Reference previous sessions and celebrate progress
- Keep engaging using their motivational hooks

CONVERSATION STYLE:
- Warm, encouraging, and patient
- Age-appropriate language
- Show genuine curiosity about their world
- Celebrate wins and progress
- Ask engaging questions that spark curiosity
- Make learning feel like an adventure

Remember: You're nurturing a love of learning!
```

### 4. **VAPI Assistant Configuration**
- **Add our MCP tool** to the assistant
- **Enable the tool** for function calling
- **Set the prompt** above
- **Publish** the assistant

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Auto-Discovery Process**
1. **Call Starts**: VAPI queries our MCP server at `/mcp/tools`
2. **Tool Discovery**: VAPI finds `get-student-context` with schema:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "get-student-context",
     "description": "Get student profile by phone number or student ID",
     "parameters": {
       "phone_number": {"type": "string"},
       "student_id": {"type": "string"}
     }
   }
   ```
3. **LLM Access**: Tool becomes available to LLM during conversation
4. **Function Call**: LLM calls `get_student_context(phone_number="{{customer.number}}")`
5. **Response**: Our server returns student profile or "unknown_phone_number"

### **Phone Number Flow**
```
Caller: +1234567890
→ VAPI: {{customer.number}} = "+1234567890"
→ LLM: "I should look up this student"
→ Function Call: get_student_context(phone_number="+1234567890")
→ MCP Server: PhoneMappingManager.get_student_by_phone("+1234567890")
→ Response: Student profile data or unknown_phone_number error
→ LLM: Adapts conversation based on result
```

## 🎯 **Key Benefits of This Approach**

1. **No OpenAI Assistant Needed**: VAPI handles everything
2. **Auto-Discovery**: VAPI finds our tools automatically
3. **Phone Integration**: {{customer.number}} available in VAPI context
4. **Simple Prompt**: Just conversation instructions, no function calling syntax
5. **Already Built**: Our MCP server is perfect for this!

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy to Render.com**: Upload our existing MCP server
2. **Configure VAPI**: Add our MCP server URL in dashboard
3. **Test Integration**: Make test calls to verify phone lookup works
4. **Production Ready**: System is complete!

## 💡 **Why This is Better**

- **Simpler**: No OpenAI Assistant complexity
- **Native**: Uses VAPI's designed MCP integration
- **Automatic**: Tool discovery happens at runtime
- **Scalable**: Easy to add more MCP tools later
- **Reliable**: Direct VAPI → MCP → Response flow

Our implementation is actually perfect for VAPI's MCP architecture!
