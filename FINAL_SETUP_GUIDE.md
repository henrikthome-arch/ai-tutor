# ðŸŽ¯ AI Tutor PoC - Final Setup Guide

## Current Status: 80% Complete! ðŸŽ‰

Your AI Tutor system is working perfectly! Here's how to complete the final 20%:

## Step 1: Install ngrok (5 minutes)

1. **Download ngrok:**
   - Go to https://ngrok.com/download
   - Download the Windows version
   - Extract `ngrok.exe` to a folder like `C:\ngrok\`

2. **Create free account:**
   - Go to https://ngrok.com/signup
   - Sign up for free
   - Copy your auth token from the dashboard

3. **Setup ngrok:**
   - Open a **new** PowerShell window (keep your server running!)
   - Navigate to ngrok: `cd C:\ngrok\`
   - Authenticate: `.\ngrok.exe authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE`

## Step 2: Create Public Tunnel (2 minutes)

In the same PowerShell window:
```bash
.\ngrok.exe http 3000
```

You'll see:
```
Forwarding  https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3000
```

**ðŸ“‹ Copy this HTTPS URL** - you'll need it for OpenAI!

## Step 3: Test Your Public URL (1 minute)

Open your browser and visit: `https://YOUR_NGROK_URL.ngrok.io/health`

You should see: `{"status": "healthy", "server": "Python AI Tutor Server"}`

## Step 4: Create OpenAI Assistant (10 minutes)

1. **Go to OpenAI Platform:**
   - Visit https://platform.openai.com/assistants
   - Sign in to your OpenAI account

2. **Create Assistant:**
   - Click "Create"
   - **Name:** `AI Tutor`
   - **Model:** `gpt-4o` (recommended) or `gpt-4-turbo`
   
3. **Add Instructions:**
```
You are an AI tutor specialized in personalized education for children aged 6-12. Your core mission is to create engaging, adaptive learning experiences.

ALWAYS start every session by calling get-student-context to retrieve the student's complete profile and progress.

Key Principles:
- Adapt teaching style to student's interests and learning preferences
- Use themes that connect to student interests (dinosaurs, space, animals, etc.)
- Provide encouragement and celebrate achievements
- Break complex concepts into manageable steps
- Check understanding frequently with questions
- Suggest activities matching the student's learning style

Teaching Approach:
- Keep sessions interactive and engaging (games, stories, challenges)
- Use visual aids and hands-on activities for visual learners
- Connect lessons to curriculum goals while maintaining fun
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Adapt difficulty based on current progress level

Before starting ANY tutoring session, you MUST use the get-student-context tool with the student's ID.
```

4. **Add Function Tool:**
   - In "Tools" section, click "Add Tool" â†’ "Function"
   - **Name:** `get_student_context`
   - **Description:** `Get comprehensive student data including profile, progress, recent sessions, and curriculum`
   - **Parameters:**
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "student_id": {
      "type": "string", 
      "description": "Student identifier (e.g., emma_smith)"
    }
  },
  "required": ["student_id"]
}
```

5. **Configure Function Call:**
   - **Method:** POST
   - **URL:** `https://YOUR_NGROK_URL.ngrok.io/mcp/get-student-context`
   - **Headers:** 
     ```
     Content-Type: application/json
     ```

6. **Save Assistant**

## Step 5: Test Complete System (5 minutes)

1. **Start conversation with your Assistant:**
   ```
   I'd like to start a tutoring session with emma_smith
   ```

2. **Expected Response:**
   The Assistant should:
   - Automatically call the get-student-context function
   - Receive Emma's profile (dinosaur/space interests, visual learner, etc.)
   - Greet Emma personally mentioning her interests
   - Suggest appropriate activities based on her Grade 4 progress

3. **Test Personalization:**
   ```
   What math topic should we work on today?
   ```
   
   The tutor should suggest division problems with dinosaur themes (based on Emma's progress and interests).

## Step 6: Add Voice (Optional - 15 minutes)

### Option A: VAPI (Recommended)
1. Go to https://vapi.ai
2. Create account and connect your OpenAI Assistant
3. Configure voice settings (choose child-friendly voice)
4. Get phone number or web widget for voice interaction

### Option B: Superinterface
1. Go to https://superinterface.ai
2. Connect your OpenAI Assistant
3. Enable voice features

## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! Your PoC is Complete!

### What You Now Have:

âœ… **Personalized AI Tutor** that knows Emma loves dinosaurs and space
âœ… **Adaptive Learning** based on her visual learning style and current progress  
âœ… **Curriculum Alignment** with Grade 4 international school standards
âœ… **Session Tracking** with detailed progress monitoring
âœ… **Engaging Content** using her interests to make learning fun
âœ… **Voice Capability** (if you completed Step 6)

### Example Interaction:

**You:** "Start tutoring session with emma_smith"

**AI Tutor:** "Hi Emma! I see you're working on division in math and you love dinosaurs! How about we help some paleontologists divide fossil discoveries among museums? We found 36 T-Rex teeth that need to be shared equally among 4 museums. Can you figure out how many teeth each museum gets?"

**Child:** "Let me draw this out... 36 divided by 4..."

**AI Tutor:** "Great strategy! I know you're a visual learner, so drawing really helps. Take your time working through it..."

## Troubleshooting

### Server Issues
- **"Server not responding":** Make sure `python simple-server-fixed.py` is still running
- **Port error:** Change port in the Python file if needed

### ngrok Issues  
- **Tunnel expired:** Free tunnels last 2 hours - just restart ngrok
- **New URL:** Update the OpenAI Assistant function URL when ngrok gives you a new URL

### OpenAI Assistant Issues
- **Function not called:** Check that ngrok URL is correct and accessible
- **No student data:** Verify the function call URL and that server is running

## Next Development Steps

1. **Add More Students** - Create profiles for other children
2. **Session Analysis** - Auto-generate progress reports
3. **Parent Dashboard** - View child's learning progress
4. **More Subjects** - Expand beyond math/English
5. **Advanced Features** - Homework help, quiz generation, etc.
