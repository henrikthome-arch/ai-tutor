# 🤖 OpenAI Assistant Setup - Final Step

## ✅ Your System is Live: https://ai-tutor-ptnl.onrender.com

Now let's connect your live AI tutor system to OpenAI Assistant for intelligent conversations!

---

## 🎯 Step 1: Test Your Live Server

**Verify these endpoints work:**

```
Health Check:
https://ai-tutor-ptnl.onrender.com/health

Student Data:
https://ai-tutor-ptnl.onrender.com/mcp/get-student-context?student_id=emma_smith
```

Both should return data. If not, check your Render.com dashboard.

---

## 🤖 Step 2: Create OpenAI Assistant

1. **Go to:** https://platform.openai.com/assistants
2. **Click:** "Create Assistant" 
3. **Configure:**

```
Name: AI Tutor - International School
Instructions: You are an adaptive AI tutor for international school students. Use the get_student_context function to access detailed student profiles, progress data, and Cambridge Primary curriculum information. Personalize your teaching based on the student's learning style, interests, current progress, and psychological profile. Always align lessons with curriculum requirements and provide encouragement based on the student's personality traits.
Model: gpt-4o (recommended) or gpt-4
```

---

## 🔧 Step 3: Add Function Tool

**Click "Add Tool" → "Function" → Configure:**

```json
{
  "name": "get_student_context",
  "description": "Get comprehensive student profile, progress tracking, and curriculum data for personalized tutoring",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "student_id": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Student identifier (e.g., 'emma_smith')",
        "enum": ["emma_smith"]
      }
    },
    "required": ["student_id"]
  }
}
```

**⚠️ Important:** There is NO "URL" field in OpenAI Assistant setup. The function calls are handled by your integration script.

---

## 💻 Step 4: Set Up Integration Script (Runs Locally)

**✅ The cloud URL is already configured!** No code changes needed.

1. **Install requirements:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Edit the [`.env`](.env) file:**
Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values:

```bash
# Your OpenAI API Key (get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here

# Your OpenAI Assistant ID (get after creating Assistant in step 2)
ASSISTANT_ID=asst_your-actual-assistant-id-here
```

**💡 How it works:**
- The integration script runs **locally on your computer**
- It connects to **your cloud server** at https://ai-tutor-ptnl.onrender.com
- It acts as a **bridge** between OpenAI Assistant and your student data

---

## 🧪 Step 5: Test End-to-End System

**Run the integration:**
```bash
python ai_tutor_integration.py
```

**Test message:**
```
"Tell me about Emma Smith's learning progress and suggest a math lesson for her"
```

**Expected flow:**
1. ✅ Integration script connects to OpenAI Assistant
2. ✅ Assistant calls `get_student_context` function  
3. ✅ Script calls https://ai-tutor-ptnl.onrender.com/mcp/get-student-context?student_id=emma_smith
4. ✅ Returns Emma's complete profile, progress, and curriculum data
5. ✅ Assistant provides personalized tutoring response

---

✅ **Integration script running** without errors  
✅ **Function calls working** (calls your live server)
